"1","Cognitive factors in the conditioning of children's preferences","Investigated the effects of cognitive factors on 1st grade children's evaluations of a rewarded stimulus. The same stimulus was rewarded in 1 set of conditions and a different stimulus was rewarded in another, over 3 sessions. These conditions were orthogonally crossed with number of ratings or filler tasks made on 4 alternate days. A control for the effect of frequency of experience was provided. All Ss rated stimuli on the final or 7th day. The frequency of association of rewards with a critical stimulus was clearly related to the development of preferences. In addition, preference for a stimulus increased as a function of the number of ratings, especially for Ss who rated the same stimulus over all sessions, and as a function of the S's awareness of the E's reinforcement procedure and behavioral hypotheses. Alternate interpretations based on response-reward contingencies, frequency of exposure, and demand characteristics were provided.

"2","Positive and negative attitudinal affect established by classical conditioning","Paired meaningful adjectives with the onset and offset of electric shock, to establish 2 attitudes, 1 based on negative affect and 1 based on positive affect, within each of 47 female undergraduates. Words paired with the onset of shock were evaluated more negatively; words paired with the offset of shock, more positively. Conditioned affect also generalized to words similar in meaning. Results were stronger for Ss who showed independent physiological evidence of conditioning and for the adjective which was initially more neutral in evaluation. The success of an elaborate cover story, including a disguised posttest given by a 2nd E, suggested that the demand characteristics of the experimental situation could not account for the data.

The remaining Ss merely heard the model verbalize that he thought the appropriate behavior was to donate 1/2 of what he won to charity (verbalization condition). Ss then played the game alone and the amount of sharing they did was observed through a 1-way mirror. All Ss in the performance condition and nurtured females in the verbalization condition shared equally. The remaining Ss in the verbalization condition did not differ from a control group which was not exposed to any model and which virtually did not share. (23 ref.)

"5","Relative effectiveness and validity of mood induction procedures: A meta-analysis","The effectiveness and validity of 11 mood induction procedures (MIPs) were compared by meta-analysis of 138 studies published in 1975–1990 in 22 scientific journals. 250 effects of the experimental induction of positive, elated and negative, depressed mood in adult nonclinical samples were integrated. Effect sizes were generally larger for negative mood inductions. Presentation of a film or story was most effective in inducing both mood states. Effects were especially large when Ss were explicitly instructed to enter the specified mood state. For elated mood, all other MIPs yielded considerably lower effectiveness scores. For induction of negative mood states, imagination, Velten, music, social interaction, and feedback MIPs were about as effective as the film/story MIP without instruction. Induction effects covaried with several study characteristics (e.g., control of demand characteristics, use of behavioral vs self-report measures).

A review of the empirical literature in this area indicates that (1) inter-reviewer reliability in manuscript assessments is clearly inadequate, (2) reviewer bias can sometimes influence manuscript assessments, and (3) there is a dearth of empirical data supporting the predictive and discriminant validity of manuscript assessment procedures. Manuscript reviews seem to be more strongly influenced by chance factors than by systematic reviewer or editorial bias. An alternative approach to manuscript review based on an adversary model rather than a scientific model is presented.

"9","Psychological effects of complex environments during the life span: A review and theory","Reviews the literature supporting a theory of psychological effects of complex environments, which was suggested by research on the causal relationships between occupational conditions and psychological functioning. According to the theory, the complexity of an individual's environment is defined by its stimulus and demand characteristics: Stimuli of greater diversity and complexity will lead to increased intellectual flexibility and more self-directed orientation. It is suggested that environmental complexity leads to effective cognitive functioning across all stages of the life span. This effect has been found in both sexes, in several nations, and in other species. Although the evidence is not as extensive, environmental complexity also appears to lead to a self-directed rather than conformist orientation because, it is contended, complex environments reward initiative and independent judgment.

"10","Hypnosis in the treatment of phobias: A review of the literature","A review of the clinical and experimental literature on the use of hypnosis in the treatment of phobic behavior indicates the following: (1) Hypnosis can be a powerful adjunct to the behavior therapies, particularly systematic desensitization. Hypnosis can also be used adjunctively in traditional insight-oriented therapy, although this form of treatment tends to be less effective with phobic behavior. (2) Treatment outcome will be enhanced when the phobia is discrete and singular rather than characterological or multiple. Self-referral and high motivation to change are good prognostic indicators, as is a high level of assessed hypnotic susceptibility. (3) The success of behavioral hypnotherapy can be attributed to enhanced ability to relax and produce vivid imagery as well as to the demand characteristics of the therapy situation and the heightened motivation and expectancy. (4) There is a need for more controlled research using clinical populations. At present, this area of clinical research is limited by serious methodological difficulties, including inadequate samples, inappropriate control groups, poorly defined treatments, and unvalidated outcome measures. A table is appended that lists 40 case studies reported from 1969 to 1981 and briefly describes the phobia studied and the treatment strategy and the outcome measure used in each.

"11","External versus self-reinforcement: A review of methodological and theoretical issues","A review of 21 experiments indicates that the following methodologies prevent a definitive resolution to the question of whether or not self-reinforcement is a legitimate reinforcement operation: (a) the failure of many self-reinforcement (SR)-external reinforcement (ER) comparative experiments to operationally distinguish the functions from the structures of reinforcement operations; (b) the use of a variety of yoking procedures that attempt to equate ER, SR, and control groups for comparison purposes; (c) component dependencies in SR operations; (d) demand characteristics that confound ER and SR comparisons; and (e) the employment of both contingent and noncontingent reward procedures across and within the reviewed experiments. At the theoretical level, paradigmatic inadequacies and ideological biases are considered to further confuse the central issues of SR legitimacy and distinctiveness. It is concluded that there is no compelling reason to support a bifurcated ""self-external"" reinforcement theory.

"12","Theory and research concerning the notion of Black self-hatred: A review and reinterpretation","Reviews theoretical models of Black self-hatred. Most conceptions, including the ""looking-glass model,"" have grown out of self-concept theory, which emphasizes social interaction and assumes that Blacks suffer debilitating pathological effects from the psychological stresses imposed upon them by Euro-American racism and its practices. Several case studies reporting the predominance of color conflicts and inferiority feelings in Black psychiatric patients are criticized for sampling and other methodological defects. The diverse and ambiguous nature of field surveys, generally used to support the construct validity of self-hatred theories, makes it difficult to determine their precise relationship to the self-hatred hypotheses. A representative group of preference studies are cited, which seem to support a theory of Black self-hatred, although none of these gave serious consideration to cultural differences among Black Ss or to the diverse meanings of stimulus objects. Other studies display (a) ambiguous findings, suggesting inherent problems in the nature of the stimuli and responses; (b) uncontrolled experimenter effects; and (c) demand characteristics. It is concluded that much of the literature is unreliable and invalid, with findings that are inconsistent and not statistically significant. Cross-cultural approaches in future research are recommended.

"13","Behavioral approaches to weight control: An updated review","Surveyed recent developments in the behavioral treatment of obesity. Results show that no studies of aversive therapy have been published since the author's (1973) earlier review. Three studies of covert sensitization have yielded discouraging results. Any positive effects of this technique appear to be the result of nonspecific demand characteristics rather than aversive conditioning. Several demonstrations of the effects of therapist controlled reinforcement indicate that this technique can promote weight loss while the contingencies are in effect. The weight is rapidly regained, however, after the contingencies are withdrawn. It is concluded that self-control treatments, especially complex self-control, are the most consistently successful treatment approaches.

"14","Experimental and Psychotherapeutic Demand Characteristics and the Cognitive Therapy Rationale: An Analogue Study","In cognitive therapy (CT) for depression, the treatment rationale is presented in lay terms as an ABC sequence such that A represents a recent event, B represents automatic thoughts about the event, and C represents the resulting affective response. The role of demand characteristics in rationales such as this has been extensively explored in research on systematic desensitization but little has been done with regards to CT. This study investigated the influence of the CT rationale and an alternative rationale on participants' self-reported thoughts and feelings in response to images. While the CT rationale assumes that cognition precedes and causes affect, the alternative rationale flipped the terms of ABC into an ACB theory in which affect is assumed to precede and cause cognition. We found that both rationales influenced reporting: Those who received the ABC rationale reported that more automatic thoughts were evoked first, while those who received the ACB rationale reported that more automatic feelings were evoked first. The rationales also were more influential on high arousal images and less influential for participants with previous therapy experience...

Analysis of variance indicated a significant similarity effect (p &lt; .0001), with neither the instructions nor the interaction yielding significance. Exp. Iii with 394 undergraduates, replicated the 2 conditions in which ss were asked to behave opposite to the hypothesis along with 2 new groups which heard a false hypothesis, I.e., opposites attract.

To test this proposition, demand characteristics for positive opinion-change were communicated in a pretest-posttest design with 144 undergraduates as ss. The psychology research survey (prs) was developed to measure ss' attitudes toward psychology. Although all ss showed significant opinion-change, it was found, as predicted, that ss with more positive attitudes toward psychology showed significantly greater opinion change than ss with less positive attitudes. In addition, prs scores were significantly positively correlated with posttest and opinion-change scores and nonsignificantly correlated with pretest scores.

"19","Discrete-state versus continuous models of the confidence-accuracy relationship in recognition memory","The relationship between confidence and accuracy in recognition memory is important in real-world settings (e.g., eyewitness identification) and is also important to understand at a theoretical level. Signal detection theory assumes that recognition decisions are based on continuous underlying memory signals and therefore inherently predicts that the relationship between confidence and accuracy will be continuous. Almost invariably, the empirical data accord with this prediction. Threshold models instead assume that recognition decisions are based on discrete-state memory signals. As a result, these models do not inherently predict a continuous confidence-accuracy relationship. However, they can accommodate that result by adding hypothetical mapping relationships between discrete states and the confidence rating scale. These mapping relationships are thought to arise from a variety of factors, including demand characteristics (e.g., instructing participants to distribute their responses across the confidence scale). However, until such possibilities are experimentally investigated in the context of a recognition memory experiment, there is no sense in which threshold models adequately explain confidence ratings at a theoretical level. Here, we tested whether demand characteristics might account for the mapping relationships required by threshold models and found that confidence was continuously related to accuracy (almost identically so) both in the presence of strong experimenter demands and in their absence. We conclude that confidence ratings likely reflect the strength of a continuous underlying memory signal, not an attempt to use the confidence scale in a manner that accords with the perceived expectations of the experimenter.

"20","Hypothesis awareness as a demand characteristic in laboratory-based eating behaviour research: An experimental study","Demand characteristics are thought to undermine the validity of psychological research, but the extent to which participant awareness of study hypotheses affects laboratory-measured eating behaviour studies has received limited attention. Participants (N = 84) attended two laboratory sessions in which food intake was measured. In session 1 baseline food intake was measured. In session 2 participants were allocated to either a ‘hypothesis aware’ or ‘hypothesis unaware’ condition. Participants were led to believe in the ‘hypothesis aware’ condition that they were expected to increase their food intake in session 2 relative to session 1. Participants in the ‘hypothesis unaware’ condition were not provided with hypothesis information. Contrary to our pre-registered predictions, the experimental manipulation of hypothesis awareness did not affect session 2 food intake. However, the manipulation was less effective than anticipated as some participants did not appear to believe the hypothesis information provided. Post-hoc exploratory analyses revealed that participants who believed the study hypothesis was that their food intake would increase in session 2 ate more in session 2 than participants who did not believe this was the study hypothesis. Further confirmatory research is required to understand the causal effect that participant awareness of study hypotheses has on laboratory measured eating behaviour.

While the study’s principal investigator has minimized the influence of this orientation, critics have speculated that it provided a “script” for guard abuse. In the present studies, participants were presented with a hypothetical prison simulation study and randomly assigned as guards to an orientation session that included these expectations (Stanford orientation) or one providing basic study information. Across three studies, participants exposed to the Stanford orientation relative to a control orientation, reported greater expectations for hostile and oppressive behavior on the part of the study’s investigator and from others and themselves as guards. The present results provide empirical support for speculation that the language of the guard orientation in the Stanford prison experiment sanctioned abuse among guards.

"22","Teaching psychology research methodology across the curriculum to promote undergraduate publication: An eight-course structure and two helpful practices","This article describes a systematic set of methodology courses and two specific practices in undergraduate publication. Major challenges in teaching research methods include students’ limited ability to (a) build a study that makes a clear prediction with rival hypotheses, and (b) to think clearly and logically through key issues such as randomization, control conditions, double-blind testing, counterbalancing, power, sample size, experimenter effects, and demand characteristics. Another challenge is to have the student exert tighter controls in non-experimental studies. Another major issue is that of obtaining prior approval from institutional research ethics boards, which requires careful time scheduling and attention to detail in the required documentation. To plan ahead of time, pilot testing is vitally needed, and this testing itself may require ethics approval, leading possibly to an infinite logical regress unless common sense is applied. Involving undergraduates in the publication process is not easy, but that the present seeming success is related in part to the cumulative course structure, to the explicit identification and discussion of challenges, and to the two systematic exercises outlined in the article.

"23","Did I do that? Expectancy effects of brain stimulation on error-related negativity and sense of agency","This study examines the effects of expected transcranial stimulation on the error(-related) negativity (Ne or ERN) and the sense of agency in participants who perform a cognitive control task. Placebo transcranial direct current stimulation was used to elicit expectations of transcranially induced cognitive improvement or impairment. The improvement/impairment manipulation affected both the Ne/ERN and the sense of agency (i.e., whether participants attributed errors to oneself or the brain stimulation device): Expected improvement increased the ERN in response to errors compared with both impairment and control conditions. Expected impairment made participants falsely attribute errors to the transcranial stimulation. This decrease in sense of agency was correlated with a reduced ERN amplitude. These results show that expectations about transcranial stimulation impact users’ neural response to self-generated errors and the attribution of responsibility—especially when actions lead to negative outcomes. We discuss our findings in relation to predictive processing theory according to which the effect of prior expectations on the ERN reflects the brain’s attempt to generate predictive models of incoming information. By demonstrating that induced expectations about transcranial stimulation can have effects at a neural level, that is, beyond mere demand characteristics, our findings highlight the potential for placebo brain stimulation as a promising tool for research.

"24","Attention or instruction: Do sustained attentional abilities really differ between high and low hypnotisable persons?","Previous research has suggested that highly hypnotisable participants (‘highs’) are more sensitive to the bistability of ambiguous figures—as evidenced by reporting more perspective changes of a Necker cube—than low hypnotisable participants (‘lows’). This finding has been interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that highs have more efficient sustained attentional abilities than lows. However, the higher report of perspective changes in highs in comparison to lows may reflect the implementation of different expectation-based strategies as a result of differently constructed demand characteristics according to one’s level of hypnotisability. Highs, but not lows, might interpret an instruction to report perspective changes as an instruction to report many changes. Using a Necker cube as our bistable stimulus, we manipulated demand characteristics by giving specific information to participants of different hypnotisability levels. Participants were told that previous research has shown that people with similar hypnotisability as theirs were either very good at switching or maintaining perspective versus no information. Our results show that highs, but neither lows nor mediums, were strongly influenced by the given information. However, highs were not better at maintaining the same perspective than participants with lower hypnotisability. Taken together, these findings favour the view that the higher sensitivity of highs in comparison to lows to the bistability of ambiguous figures reflect the implementation of different strategies.

"25","Examining the effects of a multifaceted intervention on brain anatomy and function","The capacity for the human brain to change in response to training has only recently begun to be appreciated. Moreover, examinations of the effects of training on brain anatomy and function have typically focused on the outcomes produced by narrowly focused training programs targeting a minimal number of domains. However, such programs neglect consideration of the fact that many outcomes may be produced by interacting causal factors, and that simultaneous change may be possible across many outcome dimensions. Two multifaceted lifestyle-change intervention programs were run at the University of California, Santa Barbara: designed to enable positive changes within multiple dimensions of physiological, cognitive, and psychological well-being, and implemented for the purpose of examining the capacity for concurrent and multifaceted change within individuals. The interventions were extraordinarily effective at producing positive outcomes across their targeted dimensions, yet a key question remains: To what extent were the effects produced by these interventions associated with neurally-instantiated changes within the brain? Evidence of changes in the functional organization of brain activity or in indices of anatomical function and efficiency would provide much-desired support for the notion that the intervention effects observed were due to real physiological alterations in nervous system function rather than superficial effects based on demand characteristics, motivation, or testing. The present research explores the effects of these multifaceted intervention studies on brain anatomy and function. Intervention-induced changes in resting-state brain function were discovered amongst three key regions: one involved in self-referential processing and mind-wandering (the posterior cingulate cortex), one involved in executive processes (the middle temporal gyrus), and another associated with interoception and salience processing (the insula). Using a novel dynamic functional connectivity approach, intervention effects were also uncovered within brain function during a mindful-breathing sustained attention task, such that individuals spent a greater proportion of the task in a functional connectivity state reflective of focused attention following the intervention. Finally, the intervention program was also able to produce anatomical changes: cortical thickness within insular cortex increased as a result of the intervention. Together, these findings provide converging support for results obtained from more narrowly focused intervention programs, reveal an association between many functional changes within the brain and improvements in dispositional mindfulness, and demonstrate the efficacy of the interventions at inducing changes in brain anatomy and function.

"26","The effect of light-intensity cycling on mood and working memory in response to a randomized, placebo-controlled design","Objective: Prior attempts to measure psychological responses to exercise are potentially limited by a failure to account for participants' expectations, the absence of a valid exercise placebo, and demand characteristics. The purpose of this study was to explore the main and interactive effects of a manipulation designed to increase expectations about the psychological benefits of an acute bout of active, light-intensity (treatment), and passive (placebo) cycling on mood and cognition. Demand characteristics were attenuated during recruitment, informed consent, and interactions with test administrators by communicating to participants that the study purpose was to assess the effects of active and passive cycling on respiration, heart rate, and muscle activation. Methods: A repeated-measures, randomized, placebo-controlled design ( n = 60) was used with cycling (active, passive) and information (informed, not informed) as between-subjects factors. State anxiety, feelings of energy, and working memory (percent accuracy and reaction time for correct responses) were measured at baseline (time 1), immediately after cycling (time 2) and 20 minutes after cycling (time 3). Results: Most participants did not guess the purpose of the study (~92%) or expect a reduction in state anxiety (85%) or an increase in energy (80%) or cognitive performance (~93%). Mood and cognitive performance were not improved by active or passive cycling (all p values = .12). Conclusions: The methods used here to disguise the experimental hypotheses provide a potential framework for reducing demand characteristics and placebo responses in future investigations of psychological responses to exercise.

"27","Choice-making, expectations, and treatment positivity: How and when choosing shapes aversive experiences","Every day we use products and treatments with unknown but expected effects, such as using medication to manage pain. In many cases, we have a choice over which products or treatments to use; however, in other cases, people choose for us or choices are unavailable. Does choosing (versus not choosing) have implications for how a product or treatment is experienced? The current experiments examined the role of choice-making in facilitating so-called expectation assimilation effects —or situations in which a person's experiences (e.g., discomfort and pain) are evaluated in a manner consistent with their expectations. In Experiment 1, participants were initially exposed to a baseline set of aversive stimuli (i.e., sounds). Next, some participants were given expectations for two ""treatments"" (i.e., changes in screen display) that could ostensibly reduce discomfort. Critically, participants were either given a choice or not about which of the two treatments they preferred. Participants in a control condition were not provided with treatment expectations. Results revealed that discomfort experiences assimilated to expectations only when participants were provided with choice. Experiment 2 replicated this finding and provided evidence against the idea that demand characteristics and choice-making unrelated to the core task (i.e., choices without associated expectations) could account for the results. Further, Experiment 2 showed that choosing reduced discomfort because of increased positivity about the treatment. Results are discussed in the context of extant research on choice-making and expectation effects.

"28","The social psychology of perception experiments: Hills, backpacks, glucose, and the problem of generalizability","Experiments take place in a physical environment but also a social environment. Generalizability from experimental manipulations to more typical contexts may be limited by violations of ecological validity with respect to either the physical or the social environment. A replication and extension of a recent study (a blood glucose manipulation) was conducted to investigate the effects of experimental demand (a social artifact) on participant behaviors judging the geographical slant of a large-scale outdoor hill. Three different assessments of experimental demand indicate that even when the physical environment is naturalistic, and the goal of the main experimental manipulation was primarily concealed, artificial aspects of the social environment (such as an explicit requirement to wear a heavy backpack while estimating the slant of a hill) may still be primarily responsible for altered judgments of hill orientation.

"29","Taboo, emotionally valenced, and emotionally neutral word norms","Although taboo words are used to study emotional memory and attention, no easily accessible normative data are available that compare taboo, emotionally valenced, and emotionally neutral words on the same scales. Frequency, inappropriateness, valence, arousal, and imageability ratings for taboo, emotionally valenced, and emotionally neutral words were made by 78 native-English-speaking college students from a large metropolitan university. The valenced set comprised both positive and negative words, and the emotionally neutral set comprised category-related and category-unrelated words. To account for influences of demand characteristics and personality factors on the ratings, frequency and inappropriateness measures were decomposed into raters' personal reactions to the words versus raters' perceptions of societal reactions to the words (personal use vs. familiarity and offensiveness vs. tabooness, respectively). Although all word sets were rated higher in familiarity and tabooness than in personal use and offensiveness, these differences were most pronounced for the taboo set. In terms of valence, the taboo set was most similar to the negative set, although it yielded higher arousal ratings than did either valenced set. Imageability for the taboo set was comparable to that of both valenced sets. The ratings of each word are presented for all participants as well as for single-sex groups. The inadequacies of the application of normative data to research that uses emotional words and the conceptualization of taboo words as a coherent category are discussed.

"30","How useful are the stages of change for targeting interventions? Randomized test of a brief intervention to reduce smoking","Objective: To see whether the stages of change are useful for targeting a brief intervention to reduce smoking based on implementation intentions. A second objective was to rule out demand characteristics as an alternative explanation for the findings of intervention studies based on the transtheoretical model and implementation intentions. Design: Participants (N = 350) were randomized to a passive control condition (questionnaire only), active control condition (questionnaire plus instruction to plan to quit), or experimental condition (questionnaire, plan to quit, form an implementation intention). Their behavior and psychosocial orientation to quit were measured at baseline and at 2-month follow-up. Main Outcome Measures: Theory of planned behavior variables, nicotine dependence, and quitting. Results: Significantly more people quit smoking in the experimental condition than in the control conditions, and the planning instructions changed intention to quit and perceived control over quitting, but not behavior. Stage of change moderated these effects such that implementation intentions worked best for individuals who were in the preparation stage at baseline. Conclusion: Harnessing both motivational and volitional processes seems to enhance the effectiveness of smoking cessation programs, although further work is required to clarify inconsistencies in the literature using the stages of change.

"31","Paired preference tests using placebo pairs and different response options for chips, orange juices, and cookies","Preference tests were performed for varieties of potato chips, orange juices and chocolate chip cookies using three response protocols: the traditional paired preference test with the ""no preference"" option, a 9-point hedonic scale and a 6-point hybrid hedonic/purchase intent scale. The different stimuli to be assessed were presented in pairs, but putatively identical stimuli were also presented as a ""placebo"" pair. Performance on the placebo pair with identical stimuli provided a measure of the hidden demand characteristics of the test protocol. The presentation of the different pairs provided a measure of preference accompanied by such hidden demand effects. Comparison between the two allowed a better measure of preference per se. The order of presentation of the identical and different pairs did show occasional slight evidence of contrast effects. For the placebo ""identical"" pairs, a majority of consumers reported false preferences. Liking questions with the hedonic and hybrid scales elicited fewer false preferences than preference questions with the paired preference protocol. Yet, the effects tended to be slight. The 6-point hedonic/purchase intent scale exhibited the fewest false preferences in the placebo condition, and this was because of its fewer categories rather than any cognitive strategy change elicited by its different labels.

Evidence is presented here, however, that subjects' generosity can be reversed by allowing them to take a partner's money. Dictator game giving therefore does not reveal concern for consequences to others existing independently of the environment, as posited in rational choice theory. It may instead be an artefact of experimentation. Alternatively, evaluations of options depend on the composition of the choice set. Implications of these possibilities are explored for experimental methodology and charitable donations respectively. The data favour the artefact interpretation, suggesting that demand characteristics of experimental protocols merit investigation, and that economic analysis should not exclude context-specific social norms.

"33","Scaling the information load of occupations: Preliminary findings of the fit between individual capacities and environmental demands","Person-Environment (P-E) fit models provide a conceptually powerful way to think about career development, vocational choice, and occupational success. The work reported here focuses on yet another pair of P-E criteria: self-reported individual capacity for information processing (the ability to tolerate information overload from a variety of stimulus sources), and the corresponding demand characteristics for information processing of the occupational environment. To achieve the aims of this project, the authors have borrowed from the literature on information processing, anthropology, and human factors to define the information load context of the occupational environment. The authors have constructed a P-E congruence scheme for five domains of information processing: information load, interpersonal load, change load, activity structure, and time structure, and employed the methods of psychophysics to quantify occupational environments across these domains. The results of this preliminary work, replicated across two cultures, are presented here.

Sixty participants were divided into two groups: those who were taught the correct mental model (stack-based) vs. those who did not receive any mental model information. The participants were then given a scenario-based task in which they were required to predict which pages would be available with a back button and those which would not be. The participants were then required to perform a standardised web browsing task and the amount of page traverses and back button usages were measured. Results showed that there were significantly fewer page traverses as a result of the mental model condition, suggesting a more efficient web page browsing resulted from the mental model training. In addition, there were surprisingly very few incorrect usages of the back button, possibly due to floor effects caused by demand characteristics. These data suggest that there is clearly an effect on web browsing navigation as a function of being taught the correct mental model.

"35","Effects of an implementation intention-based intervention on fruit consumption","Implementation intentions represent a potentially powerful means to increase fruit consumption, yet no studies have demonstrated their effects in this domain. The aim of the present study was to test the effectiveness of an implementation intention intervention to increase fruit consumption and to control for some possible demand characteristics by measuring cognition and behaviour immediately following the manipulation. A total of 120 participants were recruited and randomly allocated to a questionnaire-only control condition or an implementation intention-plus-questionnaire experimental condition. Findings revealed significant increases in fruit consumption in the experimental condition, but not in the control condition, F(1, 80) = 4.47, p &lt; 0.05, <U+03B7>² p = 0.06. These effects were independent of motivation and two possible demand characteristics. The findings provide further support for Gollwitzer's model of action phases and demonstrate that successful behaviour change interventions should target both motivation and volition.

To assess this potential confound, this study assessed mate preferences using indirect, open-ended questions, with anonymous computer administration and designated (same- or opposite-sex) targets. The frequency with which participants noted traits reflected key gender differences predicted by evolutionary accounts; evaluations of men focused more on ambitiousness, whereas evaluations of women focused more on attractiveness. The number of attractiveness comments was also greater, however, if the rated target was of the opposite sex. Kindness and intelligence comments did not show strong gender differences, although kindness-related comments were very frequent overall and particularly frequent from women participants.

"37","Communication and laboratory performance in parapsychology experiments: Demand characteristics and the social organization of interaction","This paper reports findings from a conversation analytic study of experimenter-participant interaction in parapsychology experiments. It shows how properties of communication through which the routine business of the experiment is conducted may have an impact on the research participant's subsequent performance. In this, the study explores social psychological features of the psychology laboratory. In particular, it examines aspects of Orne's (1962) account of what he called the demand characteristics of the psychological experiment. The data come from a corpus of audio recordings of experimenter-participant interaction during experiments on extra-sensory perception. These kinds of experiments, and the phenomena they purport to study, are undoubtedly controversial; however, the paper argues that there are grounds for social psychologists to consider parapsychology experiments as a class (albeit distinctive) of psychology experiments, and, therefore, as sites in which general social psychological and communicative phenomena can be studied. The empirical sections of the paper examine interaction during part of the experimental procedure when the experimenter verbally reviews a record of the participant's imagery reported during an earlier part of the experiment. The analysis shows that the way in which the experimenter acknowledges the research participants' utterances may be significant for the trajectory of the experiment and explores how the participants' subsequent performance in the experiment may be influenced by interactionally generated contingencies.

"38","The timecourse of higher-level face aftereffects","Perceptual aftereffects for simple visual attributes processed early in the cortical hierarchy increase logarithmically with adapting duration and decay exponentially with test duration. This classic time course has been reported recently for a face identity aftereffect [Leopold, D. A., Rhodes, G., Müller, K.-M., &amp; Jeffery, L. (2005). The dynamics of visual adaptation to faces. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B, 272 , 897-904], suggesting that the dynamics of visual adaptation may be similar throughout the visual system. An alternative interpretation, however, is that the classic time course is a flow-on effect of adaptation of a low-level, retinotopic component of the face identity aftereffect. Here, we examined the time course of the higher-level (size-invariant) components of two face aftereffects, the face identity aftereffect and the figural face aftereffect. Both showed the classic pattern of logarithmic build-up and exponential decay. These results indicate that the classic time course of face aftereffects is not a flow-on effect of low-level retinotopic adaptation, and support the hypothesis that dynamics of visual adaptation are similar at higher and lower levels of the cortical visual hierarchy. They also reinforce the perceptual nature of face aftereffects, ruling out demand characteristics and other post-perceptual factors as plausible accounts.

Although several studies have presented results suggesting that recalling valenced memories affects subsequent mood, their designs allow for alternative interpretations of the observed effects. Two such alternatives include the reverse effect (mood effects on memory due to non-experimental assignment to memory recall condition) and demand characteristics of the experiment. We used covert experimental assignment to memory condition, asking subjects (N = 314; 56% female) to recall memories that were primarily positive, neutral, or negative. Results showed the expected effect on mood (p &lt; .002), with reported mood worst in the negative memory condition, better in the neutral condition, and best in the positive condition. These results suggest that valenced memory recall does indeed exert an effect on mood, and may do so even without the individual's awareness.

"41","Infant information processing and family history of specific language impairment: Converging evidence for RAP deficits from two paradigms","An infant's ability to process auditory signals presented in rapid succession (i.e. rapid auditory processing abilities [RAP]) has been shown to predict differences in language outcomes in toddlers and preschool children. Early deficits in RAP abilities may serve as a behavioral marker for language-based learning disabilities. The purpose of this study is to determine if performance on infant information processing measures designed to tap RAP and global processing skills differ as a function of family history of specific language impairment (SLI) and/or the particular demand characteristics of the paradigm used. Seventeen 6- to 9-month-old infants from families with a history of specific language impairment (FH+) and 29 control infants (FH-) participated in this study. Infants' performance on two different RAP paradigms (head-turn procedure [HT] and auditory-visual habituation/recognition memory [AVH/RM]) and on a global processing task (visual habituation/recognition memory [VH/RM]) was assessed at 6 and 9 months. Toddler language and cognitive skills were evaluated at 12 and 16 months. A number of significant group differences were seen: FH+ infants showed significantly poorer discrimination of fast rate stimuli on both RAP tasks, took longer to habituate on both habituation/recognition memory measures, and had lower novelty preference scores on the visual habituation/recognition memory task. Infants' performance on the two RAP measures provided independent but converging contributions to outcome. Thus, different mechanisms appear to underlie performance on operantly conditioned tasks as compared to habituation/recognition memory paradigms. Further, infant RAP processing abilities predicted to 12- and 16-month language scores above and beyond family history of SLI. The results of this study provide additional support for the validity of infant RAP abilities as a behavioral marker for later language outcome. Finally, this is the first study to use a battery of infant tasks to demonstrate multi-modal processing deficits in infants at risk for SLI.

"42","Optimizing Personalized Normative Feedback: The Use of Gender-Specific Referents","Objective: Many brief interventions include personalized normative feedback (PNF) using gender-specific or gender-neutral referents. Several theories suggest that information pertaining to more socially proximal referents should have greater influence on one's behavior compared with more socially distal referents. The current research evaluated whether gender specificity of the normative referent employed in PNF related to intervention efficacy. Method: Following baseline assessment, 185 college students (45.2% women) were randomly assigned to one of three intervention conditions: gender-specific feedback, gender-neutral feedback, or assessment-only control. Immediately after completing measures of perceived norms, alcohol consumption, and gender identity, participants in the gender-neutral and gender-specific intervention conditions were provided with computerized information detailing their own drinking behavior, their perceptions of student drinking, and actual student drinking. Results: After a 1-month follow-up, the results indicated that normative feedback was effective in changing perceived norms and reducing alcohol consumption for both intervention groups for women and men. The results provide support, however, for changes in perceived gender-specific norms as a mediator of the effects of normative feedback on reduced drinking behavior for women only. Additionally, gender-specific feedback was found to be more effective for women higher in gender identity, relative to the gender-neutral feedback. A post-assessment follow-up telephone survey administered to assess potential demand characteristics corroborated the intervention effects. Conclusions: Results extend previous research documenting efficacy of computer delivered PNF. Gender specificity and gender identity appear to be important elements to consider for PNF intervention efficacy for women.

"43","The effectiveness of lesbian, gay, and bisexual speaker panels in facilitating attitude and behavior change among heterosexual university students","In light of the recent attention directed toward the incidence and consequences of heterosexuals' negative attitudes and behavior toward lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) students, several investigators have conducted interventions in academic settings to facilitate positive attitude change. One such intervention, LGB speaker panels, allows speakers to share information about their personal lives and establish a dialogue between the audience and the speakers concerning specific questions and issues important to audience members. Unfortunately, studies examining the effectiveness of LGB speaker panels have produced conflicting results. Additionally, many of these studies have significant methodological problems (e.g., issues concerning treatment parameters, internal validity, and dependent variable measurement) that weaken their conclusions. The present study sought to investigate the effectiveness of an LGB speaker panel in fostering positive attitude and behavioral change toward sexual minorities. The study intended to address the methodological limitations found in previous investigations by using multiple constructs and methods of assessment, using random assignment to ensure treatment and control group comparability, disguising the nature of pretests and posttests to minimize demand characteristics, and clearly defining and describing the treatment parameters. Results indicated that, in general, the speaker panel presentations facilitated positive attitude change toward sexual minorities even after pretest attitudes and all covariates (i.e., gender, level of religiosity, gender-role attitudes, prior interpersonal contact) were statistically controlled. Additionally, the LGB speaker panel presentations also had a significant effect on students' behavior toward sexual minorities. In particular, results revealed that students attending the presentation were significantly more likely than control group members to indicate a willingness to have a telephone conversation with an LGB prospective student to answer questions about campus-life. Taken together, these findings support the efficacy and usefulness of LGB speaker panel presentations as educational programs designed to combat homophobia and heterosexism on university campuses by altering negative attitudes toward sexual minorities. Future research may wish to examine whether longer-term interventions involving the presentation of information about sexual minorities in a series of repeated sessions would have an even greater beneficial effect on intolerant attitudes and prejudicial beliefs.

"44","The effect of interactive metronomertm training on response inhibition within adhd children","The effect of Interactive Metronomereg; training was investigated in 22 eight to twelve year-old children with ADHD. Pre and post measures were taken of IM timing accuracy, parent ratings of ADHD symptoms, and subscales of measures of Executive Functioning (IVA, SCWT, WCST) to tap prepotent responding, interference control, and verbal working memory, respectively. While improvements were found in IM timing accuracy, no evidence was found of improvements in Executive Functioning. While parent ratings indicated improvements in ADHD symptoms, these ratings were not related to changes in IM timing accuracy and may be laden with demand characteristics.

"45","A follow-up analogue study on the effectiveness of the cognitive rationale","Cognitive Therapy (CT) for depression presents a rationale for symptom reduction early in treatment. The rationale is described in lay terms as an ABC sequence, such that A represents a recent event, B represents automatic thoughts about the event, and C represents the resulting affective response. A previous study (Kanter, J. W., Kohlenberg, R. J., &amp; Loftus, E. F. (2004). Cognitive Therapy and Research, 28 , 229) that compared the CT rationale to an alternative (by flipping the terms of ABC into an ACB theory in which affect is assumed to proceed and cause cognition) suggested that the CT rationale may operate through demand characteristics because the alternative was equally influential. However, that study did not allow for the possibility that demand characteristics were differentially operative (perhaps one rationale produced real changes in identification of automatic thoughts while the other produced demand responding). The current study extended the previous study by manipulating demand characteristics directly and by adding a 1-week follow-up condition. Results indicate that the influence of the cognitive rationale is robust and, in contrast to the previous study, may not be dependent on demand characteristics.

"46","Outcomes from the women's wellness project: A community-focused physical activity trial for women","Background: Given the low rates of physical activity participation, innovative intervention approaches are needed to make a public health impact. Methods: The study was conducted at the Miriam Hospital/Brown Medical School in Providence, RI, and in communities of Southeastern Massachusetts from 2002 to 2005. Previously sedentary women (n = 280; mean age = 47.1; 94.6% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) Choose to Move , a self-help printed booklet (n = 93), (2) Jumpstart , a motivationally tailored, print based intervention (n = 95); or (3) Wellness, women's health materials (n = 92). Face-to-face contact at months 3 (M3) and 12 (M12) occurred within participants' communities in local libraries. Results: At M3, participants in the Jumpstart condition reported significantly more minutes of physical activity per week (M = 140.4, SE = 14.82) than participants in the Wellness condition (M = 98.1, SE = 15.09), (t(275) = 2.00, p &lt; 0.05). The Jumpstart arm showed a trend towards significance (t(275) = 1.93, p = 0.054) when compared with the CTM arm (M = 99.5, SE = 15.11); there was no significant difference between the CTM and Wellness arms (t(275) = 0.07, p = NS). At M12, there were no significant differences (F(2,275) = 0.147, p = NS) between any of the treatment arms. Conclusions: Results suggest that print-based programs for physical activity may be efficacious short-term, but more research is needed to find approaches that are effective long-term. It is possible to deliver print-based programs through existing community infrastructures, however these approaches need further evaluation to examine maintenance effects apart from the demand characteristics of a research study.

"47","A steady-state test of the demand curve analysis of relative reinforcer efficacy","The demand curve analysis of relative reinforcer efficacy (W. K. Bickel, L. A. Marsch, &amp; M. E. Carroll, 2000) predicts that preference for 1 reinforcer over another may be predicted from relative levels of consumption under single-schedule conditions. Prior experiments with human cigarette smokers have largely confirmed this prediction, but because subjects completed only 1 session under each arrangement, questions remain about the stability of single and concurrent-schedule (choice) performances. In addition, no prior tests of this prediction of the demand curve analysis have used nonhuman subjects, so questions remain about the effects of instructions and demand characteristics. In the present study, the authors examined pigeons' steady-state preferences in a closed economy across a wide range of concurrent fixed-ratio and random-ratio (RR) schedules. On the basis of the pigeons' single-schedule consumption, the demand curve analysis qualitatively predicted indifference at low ratio values and preference for the RR alternative at higher ratio values. These predictions proved correct in 88% of the cases in which the analysis predicted preferences in individual subjects at specific concurrent-schedule values. These findings offer preliminary support for the position that the predictions of the demand curve analysis hold true when steady-state performances are assessed. They also offer preliminary evidence that previous confirmations of the demand curve analysis were not due to the influence of instructions or to demand characteristics of the human laboratory setting. These findings supplement prior questioning of the coherence and utility of traditional measures of relative reinforcer efficacy.

"48","Conjoint analysis: A new approach to satisfaction with mental health treatment","Consumer input, particularly in the form of satisfaction surveys, has grown in popularity over the past two decades. However, the literature conflicts regarding the utility of these measures. This may be due in part to their susceptibility to demand characteristics and halo effects. To overcome the limitations of traditional measures, conjoint analysis was used to assess factors likely to lead to satisfaction with services in a community mental health center setting. In Study 1, 54 individuals diagnosed with a severe mental illness rated satisfaction with descriptions of potential mental health center designs. Conjoint analysis was then used to evaluate which factors contributed most to satisfaction. Conjoint analysis indicated that effectiveness of treatment contributed most to satisfaction, regardless of diagnosis or length of treatment. Study 2 found conjoint analysis to be a valid technique for examining satisfaction by exploring consumers' explanations for their preferences. Due to a low return rate, results may not generalize to other settings, and future studies should include larger sample sizes as well as careful collection of detailed demographic data.

"49","Learning style and student self-assessment skill","Purpose: In the light of the growing emphasis on independent learning and non-technical skills in education and employment, the study aims to examine the relevance of learning style to student self-assessment skill. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of first-year undergraduate students was asked to provide self-assessed marks for their coursework and to complete measures of learning style. Tutors' marks for student coursework were also gathered. Findings: Results revealed a positive correlation between a deep approach to learning and self-assessment skill, demonstrating the relevance of learning style to self-assessment skill. A negative correlation between student-estimated mark and a surface approach suggested that students are sensitive to the demand characteristics of assessments and are aware of how these correspond to their preferred learning style. Both strategic and deep approaches to learning correlated positively with tutor mark, as is commonly reported. Originality/value: It is suggested that the study provides some insight into the composition of self-assessment skill and implications for pedagogical practice are considered.

"50","Suggestibility and state anxiety: How the two concepts relate in a source identification paradigm","Source identification tests provide a stringent method for testing the suggestibility of memory because they reduce response bias and experimental demand characteristics. Using the techniques and materials of Maria Zaragoza and her colleagues, we investigated how state anxiety affects the ability of undergraduates to identify correctly the source of misleading post-event information. The results showed that individuals high in state anxiety were less likely to make source misattributions of misleading information, indicating lower levels of suggestibility. This effect was strengthened when forgotten or non-recognised misleading items (for which a source identification task is not possible) were excluded from the analysis. Confidence in the correct attribution of misleading post-event information to its source was significantly less than confidence in source misattributions. Participants who were high in state anxiety tended to be less confident than those lower in state anxiety when they correctly identified the source of both misleading post-event information and non-misled items. The implications of these findings are discussed, drawing on the literature on anxiety and cognition as well as suggestibility.

Family members of those with chronic illness are not routinely included in the management of the illness. This review takes diabetes as an example and argues that the family is important in illness management and shows why. We examine reasons for their exclusion from research and discuss the impact this has on the development of interventions that have focused solely on the person with the illness and often failed to place that person in the wider family, community and social context. Finally, future considerations, such as patient confidentiality and the potential impact on sick role behaviour, are discussed.

"52","Methodological review and meta-analysis of treatments for child and adolescent obsessive-compulsive disorder","The purpose of this investigation was twofold: (a) to critically review the quality of the methodology employed in published studies of child and adolescent treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and (b) to conduct a meta analysis of published and unpublished studies of pharmacological and behavioral treatments for pediatric OCD. For the methodological review, an exhaustive literature search yielded 93 published studies of various study designs. The threats-to-validity framework was applied, with the results indicating that the treatment literature attended acceptably to some threats but insufficiently to several others. Specifically, power was adequate to detect a large treatment effect, and reliable instruments were used in half the studies. Internal validity was perhaps the most problematic; that is, only 14% of the studies used a study design employing a control group with random assignment. With regard to construct validity, most studies failed to use multimodal assessment and relied primarily on indirect forms of measurement. Demand characteristics were free to influence results in most studies, since placebo control was used in only 12% of the studies. Finally, external validity suffered from the failure to report basic subject or clinician demographics. Prescriptive suggestions for improving treatment research are offered. Thirty-two studies, including controlled and uncontrolled trials, were included in the meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of both pharmacological and behavioral treatments. Pharmacological treatments included clomipramine, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline. Behavioral treatments consisted of variants of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure-and-response prevention (ERP). The literature was also gleaned for single-subject studies that met sufficient inclusion criteria. However, only 5 studies were found, and these were not analyzed by meta-analysis. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) revealed a significant, standardized mean effect size of 1.32. The study design variable, whether a study used a control group, accounted for 77% of the reliable variance. Study design was used as a covariate. Thus, none of the other moderator variables, including type of intervention (pharmacological versus behavioral), accounted for any significant variance. Well-designed, head-to-head comparative studies are needed to compare the relative efficacy of treatments. Implications for future research and the limitations of the current study are delineated.

"53","Individual variation in rapid eye movement sleep is associated with pain perception in healthy women: Preliminary data","Study Objectives: Sleep-deprivation experiments suggest that sleep loss increases pain sensitivity, It is unclear from preliminary studies, however, whether sleep-related processes are directly associated with pain perception or whether hyperalgesia is due to the secondary effects of sleep deprivation and/or demand characteristics. Consequently, we sought to evaluate relationships between sleep architecture and laboratory measures of pain processing in healthy women, sleeping under normal conditions. Design: Correlational, 2-night polysomnographic study with laboratory pain testing conducted on subsequent days. Setting: General clinical research center inpatient unit with private room Participants: Sixteen healthy, female, pain-free good sleepers, free from centrally acting agents (mean age=24±4.5 years) Measurement and Results: Standard polysomnographic sleep-continuity and architecture variables and subject responses to standard noxious thermal stimuli delivered to the ventral and dorsal surfaces of the forearm via thermal sensory analyzer. Ratings of thermal pain threshold as well as suprathreshold indices of central pain processing (mean/peak ratings and intensity of painful aftersensations) were obtained. Averaging across nights/days, we found significant negative relationships between rapid eye movement sleep latency and suprathreshold pain ratings, ie, measures of heightened central pain processing (r= -.64 to -.73, P&lt; .01). Significant positive relationships were also found between percentage of rapid eye movement sleep and suprathreshold ratings(r=.56 to .66, P&lt; .050). Conclusions: These data are the first to demonstrate a relationship between individual variation in rapid eye movement sleep and pain-modulatory processes. The results have implications for the etiology of pain disorders and suggest that neurobiologic substrates regulating sleep may also play a role in central pain processing.

"54","Order Quantity and Timing Flexibility in Supply Chains: The Role of Demand Characteristics","We study how differences in product demand characteristics affect the strategic value of different types of supply chain flexibility for accurate response. We propose a single-period inventory modelling framework with two ordering opportunities. The second order reflects updated demand information and potentially capitalizes on supply chain flexibility. We consider two complementary forms of flexibility: quantity flexibility in production and timing flexibility in scheduling. In this framework, we analyze the total inventory cost of a firm for alternate demand types. We model functional products through the standard assumption of independent demand over the period, fashion-driven innovative products through a Bayesian model, and innovative products with evolving demand through a Martingale process. The three demand processes exhibit very different behavior with respect to the value of the alternate forms of flexibility. We observe that quantity flexibility is of moderate value for functional goods and of high value for fashion-driven products for all lead times. Quantity flexibility is of low value for goods with evolving demand with long lead times but of high value for short lead times. Alternately, we observe timing flexibility is of highest value for functional goods, especially for cases of high holding cost, and is of lesser value for fashion-driven goods. It is of least value for goods with evolving demand. Both quantity and timing flexibility capabilities are required to significantly reduce the relevant supply chain costs for evolving-demand innovative goods when the lead times are long.

"55","The effects of message framing and gender on physical exercise communications to high school students","According to Prospect Theory (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981), people are more likely to engage in behaviors that are perceived as risky when presented messages that emphasize negative consequences (loss-framed), and are more likely to engage in safe behaviors when presented messages that emphasize positive benefits (gain-framed). In the current study, the effectiveness of exercise messages stressing the consequences of not exercising were compared to messages stressing the benefits of exercising. Rothman and Salovey (1997) assert that gain-framed messages should be most effective in the promotion of exercise because exercise maintains ones health and involves little perceived risk. This study assessed whether gender would be a moderating variable in this assertion. The primary hypothesis was that different message frames would interact with gender on a number of dependent measures. A total of 192 subjects (96 male and 96 female) were randomly assigned to two PowerPoint message-frame conditions (gain- and loss-framed) and were administered the Decisional Balance for Exercise Scale (Marcus, Rakowsky &amp; Rossi, 1992), The Stages of Change for Exercise (Marcus, Selby, Niaura &amp; Rossi, 1992), and measures of exercise involvement and message persuasion at four time intervals. While none of the predicted interactions hypotheses were statistically significant, several significant findings were observed. All subjects groups showed significant increases on the stages of change for exercise and exercise involvement measures. Furthermore, male subjects increased their exercise involvement more than females, regardless of message-frame, and subjects who viewed the loss-framed messages increased their exercise more than those who viewed the gain-framed exercise messages, regardless of gender. Additionally, males who viewed the loss-framed message increased their exercise significantly more than the other three subject groups. No significant findings were observed on the Decisional Balance measure. On the message persuasiveness measure, the gain-framed message was considered to be the more persuasive message by both genders, and males found both messages more persuasive than females. The significance of these results in relation to prospect theory is discussed. A note of caution in interpreting the results is also given regarding possible demand characteristics of the subjects. Suggestions for follow-up and future research are made.

"56","A Place to Stand","Reviews The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology , edited by Mike Knight and Gabriel Rupp (see record 2005-08200-000). Because of the importance of theory in science, where we stand is with Darwin, in nature. Evolutionary psychology is a paradigm of emergent complexity and the unity of the natural sciences; it is theory that distinguishes it from more traditional empiricist orthodoxy. Theory in evolutionary psychology functions at three levels: (a) understanding ancestral problems of survival through reverse engineering and reasoning about the demand characteristics of particular physical and social ecologies; (b) deducing a computational algorithmic description of how psychological mechanisms as adaptations reflect these demand characteristics, making it possible to formulate meaningful questions in the form of if-then logical consequences; which are then (c) translated into postulates or hypotheses amenable to experimentation (induction). Every chapter in The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology evidences the worth of these functions of theory for a science of the mind, not only summarizing the hundreds of discoveries that have been made as a result of evolutionary thinking, and would in all probability not have been made otherwise, but functioning heuristically, providing a road map for the future.

This paper revisits Tedeschi and Quigley's critique, and examines the ways that subsequent researchers have addressed the weaknesses they identified. In particular, it examines three new laboratory aggression paradigms (Hot Sauce, Bungled Procedure, and Experimental Graffiti Paradigms) that have attempted to improve upon the ""classic"" paradigms (Teacher/Learner &amp; Essay Evaluation Paradigms, Competitive Reaction Time Game, Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm, and Bobo Modelling Paradigm). In each case, this review will show, that although some aspects of the new designs are indeed improvements, many of Tedeschi and Quigley's arguments still apply. In conclusion, this investigation will identify a number of factors that future laboratory aggression researchers should consider. These include: The perceptions and motivations of the aggressor; the apparent distance between the aggressor and the target; the availability of non-aggressive response options; the problems of demand characteristics, permissive cues and agentic shift; the differences between proactive and reactive aggression, and the distinction between overt and covert forms of aggression.

"58","Effect of the Destructive Disagreement Belief on Satisfaction With One's Closest Friend","The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that, when imagining a serious disagreement with one's closest friend, verbalizing the irrational belief that disagreement is destructive would lead to greater relationship dissatisfaction than would verbalizing the rational belief that disagreement is not destructive . The author used two counter-demand-control conditions to test a second hypothesis that this effect would not be the result of demand characteristics. Undergraduates (119 women and 43 men) were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 conditions in a pretest-posttest design. In comparison with a control condition, posttest relationship dissatisfaction was significantly higher in the irrational condition and was lower, but not significantly so, in the rational condition. These results were not attributable to demand characteristics and suggested that this irrational belief increased relationship dissatisfaction.

"59","Do South African former detainees experience post-traumatic stress? Circumventing the demand characteristics of psychological assessment","Most research on persons subjected to physical or psychological torture for political reasons has framed this experience as traumatic, with the sequelae approximating the diagnostic criteria of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Yet, critiques of the trauma model have called attention to the fact that PTSD represents a Western conceptualization of the concerns of persons who have survived stressful experiences. In order to determine whether symptoms of traumatization are salient psychiatric phenomena for South African former detainees, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 respondents who were detained and tortured for political reasons during the apartheid era. Interviews were transcribed and analysed for thematic content using a grounded theory approach. Results showed that although the main concerns expressed were unrelated to traumatization, participants also indicated that they experienced symptoms of posttraumatic stress. These data suggest that although too great a focus on traumatic responses may be misplaced, it remains important to consider the possibility that former detainees may exhibit symptoms of this nature. Consequently, critiques of the trauma discourse as a Western phenomenon need to be tempered with evidence of the lived reality of psychological sequelae experienced by this population.

"60","Present concerns of survivors of human rights violations in South Africa","Most research on persons subjected to physical torture for political reasons has framed this experience as traumatic, with the sequelae approximating the diagnostic criteria of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, responses to checklists, questionnaires, and structured interview schedules may reflect the effect of demand characteristics more than the actual concerns of respondents. Thus semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 South Africans who were detained for political reasons during the apartheid era. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed with the assistance of the Atlas.ti 4.5 programme. Results showed that the major concerns expressed by the sample were somatic problems, economic marginalization, non-clinical emotional distress, and dissatisfaction with the present political dispensation in South Africa. Respondents also expressed concerns that reflected symptoms of traumatization, but these were not salient in comparison with the other themes that emerged. These data suggest that a model of trauma and the diagnostic category of PTSD may be less appropriate than suggested by most of the literature in accounting for the concerns of many South African former political detainees. This paper critiques the hegemony of the psychiatric model of traumatization in conceptualizing the needs of this population, and suggests an alternate perspective that is broader and more inclusive than a psychiatric paradigm. It also discusses the research and possible clinical implications of the results in terms of addressing the needs of former detainees in South Africa.

"61","On the methodology of body image assessment: The use of figural rating scales to evaluate body dissatisfaction and the ideal body standards of women","We examined the use of figural rating scales to measure body dissatisfaction and the ideal body standards of women. We also attended to the potential influence of demand characteristics in body assessment research using these measures, a methodological concern largely ignored in this field. We used both within- and between-subjects designs to assess whether women hold different body standards for themselves compared to their same sex peers and whether their own ideal body size (IBS) is different from what they think men prefer. Regardless of the method of data collection (within or between design), we failed to find any differences on separate items of body image ideals. The findings do provide evidence of robust and large effects for the current-ideal discrepancy as measured by figural rating scales, but argue against including multiple questions about ideal body preferences on these types of scales. Concerns about the influence of demand characteristics were not supported by the data.

It is not unusual for developmental psychologists to become frustrated with the theory of universal grammar (UG), whose proponents have tended to dismiss most research on children's language production and comprehension as irrelevant to explaining how human languages are acquired. This is because children's actual linguistic behaviour is presumed to reflect factors besides their grammatical competence, rendering most methods of sampling linguistic behaviour unsuitable for evaluating UG theory. This means, in practice, that UG proponents do not view performance errors as evidence against their hypothesis that grammatical knowledge is largely innate. When children perform at ceiling on a given task, this is usually taken as proof of their adultlike grammatical competence, while poor performance is dismissed as due to research design flaws or limitations in information processing capacities (e.g. working memory). Crain &amp; Thornton (1998) attempt to eliminate what they consider to be post hoc processing accounts of children's linguistic behaviour by arguing, counter to Chomsky (1965) and many others, that children and adults share identical language processing mechanisms, and that linguistic performance directly reflects grammatical competence. Therefore, if UG principles are available from an early age, child and adult performance should be the same when tasks are properly constructed to avoid extra-linguistic demand characteristics (excepting adult-child differences predicted by parameter-setting or maturational models). It should not be surprising then that some psycholinguists, such as Drozd (target article), would find C&amp;T to be misguided with respect to these issues, because children's linguistic behaviour surely differs from adults' in seemingly unpredictable ways. Much is at stake here, namely the defensibility of UG theory itself.

"63","Children's Developing Knowledge of the Relationship Between Mental Awareness and Pretense","This study investigated 3- and 4-year-old's understanding of the relationship between pretense and mental awareness. In Experiments 1 and 2, only a subset of 4-year-olds recognized that sleeping characters and characters ignorant of their appearance were not pretending. However, these experiments had certain linguistic demands, which potentially influenced performance. In Experiment 3, these demand characteristics were reduced; under these circumstances, 3- and 4-year-olds recognized that pretenders were aware of their actions or appearance. However, Experiment 4 showed that even using this modified procedure, 3- and 4-year-olds do not completely understand the relationship between pretense and awareness. These data support the hypotheses that by the age of 4, children have some, but not a complete, understanding of the relationship between pretense and mental awareness.

"64","Cognitive defusion and self-relevant negative thoughts: Examining the impact of a ninety year old technique","Cognitive defusion techniques are designed to reduce the functions of thoughts by altering the context in which they occur, rather than the attempting to alter the form, frequency, or situational sensitivity of the thoughts themselves. Applied technologies designed to produce cognitive defusion seem to lead to reductions in the believability of negative thoughts, but defusion techniques are generally only parts of complex packages and the role of defusion techniques per se is note yet known. The present study examined the impact of a cognitive defusion technique first described by Titchener nearly 90 years ago: rapidly repeating a single word. In series of eight single-case alternating treatment designs, this defusion technique was compared to a distraction task, and to a thought control task on reductions in the discomfort and believability of self-relevant negative thoughts. The cognitive defusion technique reduced both discomfort and believability more so than the comparison approaches. Control studies showed that the effect was probably not due to demand characteristics.

"65","Is your unconscious smarter than you are?","Reviews Strangers to Ourselves: Discovering the Adaptive Unconscious (see record 2002-18897-000). Citing evidence that too much introspection can create more confusion rather than less about one's own emotions, T. Wilson makes the case for better ways of discovering our unconscious selves, through paying attention to our actions and others' reactions to them and by adopting a new self-narrative and acting consistently with it. In some ways, the argument in this book reflects the ""automaticity juggernaut"" running through social psychology--the widespread acceptance of the proposition that our everyday experience, thought, and action is largely if not wholly under the control of reflex-like processes that run off outside phenomenal awareness and free of voluntary control. To the view that most people are on automatic pilot most of the time, Wilson adds the further proposition that we do not know what we're doing, or why, or what we feel about it. This conception of mental life is attractive to many psychologists, and other cognitive scientists, who are still made nervous by the topic of consciousness. Moreover, an emphasis on automatic, unconscious processes is compatible with the situationism that still infects much of social psychology--the view that social behavior is largely controlled by the immediate stimulus environment. Additionally, Wilson's book reflects the wide and deep acceptance of a non-Freudian view of unconscious mental life within contemporary scientific psychology. The reviewer argues that precise details of experimental methodology, including the demand characteristics of the experiment, matter a great deal in this research--an issue raised by some critics of Wilson; he does not, however, answer the charges of his critics in this book. If the book is not entirely convincing, at least it makes an interesting argument and points the direction for future research.

"66","Managerial decisions based on personnel file reviews: Organizational and situational influences","The decisions that managers make can be influenced by a number of factors. The current study examines two specific organizational factors (judgment intent and evaluation expectancy) and two task demand characteristics (situational risk and workload) that might influence the consistency, accuracy, timeliness, and quality of managerial decisions. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) results reveal that these factors do have significant influences on various aspects of managerial decisions. Most notably, the expectation of evaluation was revealed to both help and hinder decision-making, dependent on other contextual factors and situational risk consistently led to better decisions. Implications are presented for addressing these factors and helping managers make the best decisions under certain organizational and situational constraints.

"67","Fear information and the development of fears during childhood: Effects on implicit fear responses and behavioural avoidance","Field, Argyris and Knowles, and Field, Hamilton, Knowles and Plews have developed a prospective paradigm for testing Rachman's proposition that fear information is important in the development of fears and phobias in children. Despite this paradigm being an advance on retrospective reports, the research so far has been restricted to self-reported fear beliefs measured after the information is given. This gives rise to two possible shortcomings: (1) the effects could simply reflect demand characteristics resulting from children conforming to the experimental demands, and (2) although fear information changes beliefs, this might not translate into the behavioural change that would be expected if this information has a powerful effect relevant to the development of pathological fear. This paper describes an experiment that attempts to address these concerns by improving Field et al.'s basic paradigm but with the addition of two measures: (1) a behavioural measure of avoidance, and (2) an implicit attitude task that should not be susceptible to deliberate attempts to conform to experimental demands. The result showed that negative and positive information have dramatic, and opposite, effects on self-reported fear beliefs, behavioural avoidance and implicit attitudes.

"68","Measuring evaluative conditioning using the Implicit Association Test","When a neutral stimulus is paired with a stimulus that has strong affective properties, these properties often appear to be transferred to the neutral stimulus. This learning has been termed evaluative conditioning. In two experiments, participants first learned the 'meanings' of four non-words. Two of these meanings were affectively positive, and two were affectively negative. Transfer of affect was measured in the Implicit Association Test (IAT). In the IAT, a participant's affective response to an item is inferred from his or her ability to categorise that item with other pleasant and unpleasant stimuli. An item easily categorised with other liked stimuli is deemed to be liked itself. In both experiments, evidence for transfer of affect was observed in the IAT. Thus, non-words given pleasant meanings in training (evaluative conditioning) were more easily categorised with pleasant than unpleasant personality characteristics, compared to non-words given unpleasant meanings. The results suggest that the IAT is a useful way to test for evaluative conditioning. It is both sensitive to the transfer of affective properties from one stimulus to another, and, because affect is measured indirectly, the results are unlikely to be due to the demand characteristics of the experiment.

"69","The effect of structural characteristics on family planning program performance in Côte d'lvoire and Nigeria","This paper uses Côte d'lvoire and Nigeria survey data on both supply and demand characteristics to examine how structural and demographic factors influence family planning provision and cost. The model, which takes into account the endogenous influence of service provision on average cost, explains provision well but poorly explains what influences service cost. We show that both size and specialization matter. In both countries, vertical (exclusive family planning) facilities provide significantly more contraception than integrated medical establishments. In the Nigeria sample, larger facilities also offer services at lower average cost. Since vertical facilities tend to be large, they at most incur no higher unit costs than integrated facilities. These results are consistent across most model specifications, and are robust to corrections for endogenous facility placement in Nigeria. Model results and cost recovery information point to the relative efficiency of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, which operates large, mostly vertically organized facilities.

Experimental Ss were exposed to pre-experimental conditions which were designed to imply to them that sensory deprivation effects were expected to emerge. The same physical conditions were structured for control Ss in such a way as to lead them to expect nothing to happen. Results show that the groups were significantly different on a number of before and after tests, as well as in general clinical appearance, and these results were interpreted as supporting the hypothesis. An interpretation is offered of the operation of demand characteristics as a factor interacting with treatment conditions. Ways of taking demand characteristics into account in sensory deprivation research are suggested. (22 ref.)

Results indicated that these methodological artifacts moderated, but did not fully account for, the effects of posed facial expressions on emotion reports. Even when participants were explicitly told or personally believed that facial poses do not influence emotions, they still exhibited facial feedback effects.

Objects reachable with the aid of a tool were perceived to be smaller than identical objects without a tool. Participants' responses to questioning rule out demand characteristics as an explanation.

As far as quantitative evaluation is concerned, data based on objective outcome and subjective outcome evaluation studies were collected. For qualitative evaluation, data collected from open-ended questions, focus groups, and weekly diaries were examined. While these strategies are comprehensively and commonly used in the field of evaluation, there are several criticisms for these strategies. Fu^st, quantitative methods are criticized as too mechanical and looking at outcomes from the view of the experts. Second, qualitative methods are criticized as too ""soft,"" and it is difficult to generate generalizable patterns of outcomes.\Finally, there is the criticism that the informants may be able to guess the intention of the study such as in questionnaires and focus groups, hence making it possible to have inflated positive outcome effects as a result of demand characteristics.

"75","Demand characteristics, pre-test attitudes and time-on-task trends in the effects of chewing gum on attention and reported mood in healthy volunteers","Previous research has indicated that chewing gum enhances reported alertness, but has variable effects on attention. Demand characteristics may explain these effects. The current study investigated the effects of gum and demand characteristics on attention and reported mood over time. Participants completed measures of mood and attention, with and without chewing gum. To manipulate demand characteristics, they were told that the hypothesised effect of gum was either positive or negative, or no hypothesis was mentioned. Attitudes towards gum were assessed pre- and post-manipulation. Gum increased reported alertness; this effect was only significant for positive and neutral demand characteristics. Vigilance accuracy was reduced for chewing gum, but only in the fourth minute of the task, and gum reduced focussed attention accuracy, but only for the first 64 trials. Demand characteristics did not moderate time-on-task effects. Gum improved selective attention. A positive effect on response organisation was observed; this was significant when demand characteristics and pre-test attitudes to gum were both negative. The results suggest that demand characteristics moderate effects on self-reported alertness and response organisation, but cannot explain time-on-task effects or variable main effects on other aspects of attention.

"76","Reducing and reversing pseudomemories with hypnosis","As a forensic memory enhancement tool, hypnosis is problematic because it tends to increase pseudomemory responses and inflate confidence regardless of accuracy. A variety of evidence suggests that major influences in producing these effects are expectancy and demand characteristics. However, if expectancy and demand characteristics play a role in increasing false positive responses with hypnosis, it may be possible to use the same factors to reduce false positive responses. Some have argued that the standard misinformation effect in nonhypnotic situations may be influenced by expectancy and demand characteristics. Consequently, if subjects are given misleading information followed by an instruction suggesting that hypnosis will reduce the influence of misinformation, hypnosis may reduce rather than increase false positive responses, including spurious confidence in errors. In this paper two studies are described that lend some experimental support for this hypothesis. The first showed that, when participants are not given an opportunity to commit themselves to making errors, the misinformation effect can be eliminated if hypnosis is given together with a suggestion that it will help participants discriminate between correct and incorrect information. The second study showed that a similar posthypnotic suggestion was more effective than a warning alone in reducing or reversing misinformation errors even after participants had committed themselves to reporting such errors. There was no evidence of inflated confidence with hypnosis in either study.

"78","Attenuation and enhancement of compliance with experimental demand characteristics","College students chose between reinforcement schedules in which a key press produced a cartoon video followed by nonreinforcement. The experimenter introduced a demand characteristic by stating a preference for choosing one schedule while indicating that the other schedule was also acceptable. With identical schedules (25 s of reinforcement, 5 s of nonreinforcement), compliant choices approached 100%. When the designated schedule presented a 5-s reinforcer followed by a 25-s timeout, participants complied initially, and then chose the other schedule on most trials. The aversiveness of the timeout, combined with the predominantly reinforcing alternative, deterred compliance. Elaborating the instructional context by stating that choosing the designated schedule would ""help us with the data analysis"" significantly increased compliant choices but did not alter the rise-and-decline pattern found with the simpler instructions. A salient relation between an experimenter's preference and a scientific benefit thus promotes compliance with demand cues but does not insulate it from attenuation by relatively mild aversive consequences. Demand characteristics are not a uniquely powerful source of behavioral control.

Individuals who were given suggestions for anomalous experiences, relative to those who were not, reported a greater number of visual, and a suggestively greater number of vocal, hallucinations. The experience of a descriptively dissociative phenomenological state was the strongest predictor of the reporting of anomalous experiences, but only correlated with the experience of anomalous perceptions in the suggestion condition.

"81","Semantic, repetition and morphological contexts in visual word recognition: Evidence for multiple and independent feedback loops","By hypothesis, awareness is involved in the modulation of feedback from semantics to the lexical level in the visual word recognition system. Knowledge garnered from being aware of the prime [and, by extension, being aware of relatedness proportion (RP)] in a lexical decision experiment in which semantic context is manipulated and many of the prime-target pairs are related (i.e., high RP) is used to configure the system to feed activation back from semantics to the lexical level so as to facilitate processing. When subjects are unaware of the prime (and, by extension, unaware of RP), the default set is maintained in which activation is not fed back from semantics to the lexical level so as to conserve limited resources. Qualitative differences in the pattern of data from two lexical decision experiments that employ masked priming are consistent with this hypothesis. Semantic context and stimulus quality interact when the prime is processed with awareness whereas these same two factors produce additive effects on RT when the prime is unlikely to have been processed with awareness. Experiment 3 produces a repetition context by stimulus quality interaction, despite masking of the prime so as to prevent awareness and despite a low RP. This finding discounts the possibility that masking, per se, eliminated the semantic context by stimulus quality interaction in Experiment 2. More importantly, this finding also shows that the underlying components of the visual word recognition system that produce the repetition context by stimulus quality interaction are either separate from or operate differently for this type of context than they do for semantic context. In Experiment 4, semantic context and morphological context are manipulated concurrently with stimulus quality under low RP conditions. Morphology is thought to be represented at the lexical level whereas the repetition context effect reported in Experiment 3 could be attributed to it influencing the letter level, the lexical level, or both. Morphological context therefore provides a more precise measure of how the visual word recognition system operates under low RP conditions than repetition context does. Morphological context and stimulus quality interacted whereas semantic context and stimulus quality produced additive effects on performance. This result is consistent with the claim that repetition context and morphological context interact with stimulus quality under conditions where semantic context does not because they are driven by sub-components of the visual word recognition system that operate independently from the sub-components that produce the semantic context by stimulus quality interaction. The finding that two sub-components of the same functional system can operate independently from one another also speaks, in concert with other findings, to the distinction between thresholded and cascaded processing. When processing is cascaded, activation at an initial stage activates the next stage prior to processing being completed at the initial stage. This makes it difficult to explain how two sub-components of the same system can operate independently of one another. These experiments (a) illustrate one way that awareness (or lack thereof) affects the dynamics of the visual word recognition system, (b) highlight the functional separability of its underlying sub-components, and (c) provide further evidence consistent with the claim that at least some of its sub-components involve thresholded processing.

"82","Effects of exposure to thin media images: Evidence of self-enhancement among restrained eaters","The effects of viewing media-portrayed idealized body images on eating, self-esteem, body image, and mood among restrained and unrestrained eaters were examined. Study 1 found that restrained eaters (i. e., dieters), but not unrestrained eaters, rated both their ideal and current body sizes as smaller and disinhibited their food intake following exposure to idealized body images. These results suggest that restrained eaters are susceptible to a 'thin fantasy' brought about by viewing ideal body images. Study 2 found that strengthening thinness attainability beliefs can further enhance the thin fantasy demonstrated by restrained eaters following exposure to idealized body images. Study 3 examined whether demand characteristics moderate these effects of media-portrayed idealized body images.

"83","Demand characteristics and the development of dual, false belief systems","Martin Orne (1962; see record 1963-05917-001) proposed that subjects in a psychological experiment will play the role of a good subject to validate what they perceive to be the experimental hypothesis. This author suggests that the demand characteristics that ruin psychological experiments are present in a broad spectrum of human interactions. Of particular interest are situations in which subject responses result in false beliefs in the experimenter, which in turn are passed back to create false beliefs in the subject. Three examples of these dual deceptions are provided: (a) witchcraft inquisitors and accused men, (b) J. Charcot and men with hysterical symptoms, and (c) a psychic reader and her subject. Both sides of these dyads ended up with false belief systems because of demand characteristics, and these false beliefs persisted.

"87","Demand characteristics, treatment rationales, and cognitive therapy for depression","In research design, the term demand characteristics refers to the sum total of cues that convey an experimental hypothesis to subjects and influence their behavior. In psychotherapy, the term may refer to the sum total of cues that convey the therapist's wishes, expectations, and worldviews to clients and influence their behavior. Psychotherapeutic demand may play a role in dissociative identity disorder, in the repressed memory controversy, and during the delivery of treatment rationales, a practice common to manual-guided psychotherapies. An exploration of demand characteristics during the presentation of the treatment rationale in one such psychotherapy--cognitive therapy for depression--is offered, and data from an analogue study of demand responding to this rationale are presented.

"88","Demand characteristics in the laboratory and the clinic: Conversations and collaborations with subjects and patients","Martin Orne's notion of demand characteristics is related to the cooperative principle in language pragmatics: The need for experimenter and subject to have a common view of the experiment is similar to the need for speaker and listener to establish common ground in a conversation. Where experimenter and subject do not share common ground, experiments may be lacking in ecological validity. Like experimental subjects, clinical patients are engaged in effort after meaning, trying to make sense of their symptoms. In order to make sure that patient and therapist are on common ground, Orne urged clinicians to engage in anticipatory socialization and to mobilize demand characteristics in the service of treatment and prevention.

Martin Orne was one of the first to recognize the abuses of recovered memory and the fact that it involved subtle illegitimate demands as well as more legitimate ones. With recognition of the great strength of demand we are led to consider how to circumnavigate the problems it causes in psychotherapy. Observation of different 20th-century approaches suggests that when therapists made formal demands to find memories, the worst results followed.

"91","Hypnosis, demand characteristics, and ""recovered memory"" therapy","In introducing the notion of demand characteristics, Martin T. Orne acknowledged his debt to Egon Brunswik (1947), who held similar views. Orne (1959) took it several steps further by proposing the real-simulator design as a means of evaluating the degree to which experimental outcomes might be artifactual of implicit cues in the design and/or procedure of empirical studies. By contrast, demand characteristics have received relatively less clinical attention. Nevertheless, some psychodynamically oriented clinicians go to great lengths to disguise the manner in which they attempt to effect alterations in thought and behavior. The indirect procedures of Milton Erickson (Rossi, 1980) provide a telling example of how demand characteristics can compromise the clinical goal of effecting positive change.

"92","Effects of age related sensory degradation on perception of floor slipperiness and associated slip parameters","A laboratory study was conducted to determine how sensory changes in elderly people affect subjective assessments of floor slipperiness, and associated friction demand characteristics and slip distance. To relate these parameters to actual slip and fall incidents, 30 Ss from 2 age groups (young-aged 18-35 yrs and elderly-aged 65+ yrs) walked around a circular track on the slippery and non-slippery floor surfaces, while wearing a safety harness to prevent injury in case of a slip or fall. Prior to the walking experiment, the Sensory Organization Test was performed. During the experiment, subjective assessments of surface slipperiness of the floor were obtained prior to walking and after walking on the floor. Slip distance, required coefficient of friction and adjusted friction utilization were assessed utilizing motion analysis and force platform systems. The results indicate that sensory changes in the elderly increased the likelihood of slips and falls more than their younger counterparts. This was due to incorrect perceptions of floor slipperiness, and uncompensated slip parameters such as slip distance and adjusted friction utilization.

"93","Haunted by somatic tendencies: Spirit infestation as psychogenic illness","It has been suggested that haunting and poltergeist episodes are akin to outbreaks of contagious psychogenic illness. Therefore, it might be expected that hypochondriacal and somatic tendencies would significantly predict experiences of 'spirit infestation' and other paranormal ideations. This prediction was tested with 314 18-53-yr-olds who completed the Anomalous Experiences Inventory, the Transliminality Scale, and 3 questionnaires about hypochondriasis, somatic complaints, and cognitions about body and health. Results support predictions, although the type of bodily cognition varied with the specificity of the paranormal experience. Indices of spirit infestation coincided with autonomic sensations, perceived paranormal ability was related to catastrophizing cognitions, and general paranormal experiences correlated with somatization traits. Transliminality and paranormal belief contributed positively to nearly all of these associations. Findings are consistent with the idea that some paranormal experiences are partly misattributions of internal experience to external sources--a process that could initiate an episode of contagious psychogenic illness by encouraging the collective perception of similar 'symptoms' in a group of people due to suggestion and demand characteristics.

In the present study, it was tested whether the changes in mood, self-esteem and eating behavior could be activated outside of conscious attention by ultrashort exposure to either slides of thin media models, obese models or neutral slides. The subliminal exposure did not affect women's mood and self-esteem in the expected way and the eating behavior of restrained and unrestrained Ss was unaffected by the manipulation. It is concluded that pre-attentive exposure to the thin beauty ideal had no devastating effect on the well-being of women.

"95","Accelerometry: A new technique for objectively measuring real-world actual amount of use of an impaired extremity in rehabilitation patients","The current consensus in rehabilitation is that functional activity in the life situation is the most important outcome to pursue and measure (Keith, 1995). Constraint-Induced Movement (CI) therapy (Taub et al., 1993) is a new treatment for chronic upper extremity hemiparesis that consists of a family of behavioral techniques that induce stroke patients to greatly increase the use of their affected arm for many hours a day over a period of 2 to 3 weeks. The intervention has been demonstrated not only to improve the movement of the impaired upper extremity as measured by laboratory motor tests but also to increase the tendency of patients to use their arm in the real world (Duncan, 1997; Taub et al., 1993; Taub, Crago, &amp; Uswatte, 1998; Taub, Uswatte, &amp; Pidikiti, 1999). The need in CI therapy research for instruments that accurately measure changes in the amount of arm use in the real world has led directly to the work presented in this dissertation. Arm use in the home situation is currently measured by a structured interview called the Motor Activity Log (MAL; Taub et al., 1993; Uswatte &amp; Taub, 1998). As with other self-report measures, the MAL has some drawbacks; patients' answers maybe influenced by experimenter bias, demand characteristics, or inaccurate recall. The purpose of this dissertation is to bypass the measurement problems associated with the MAL by developing an objective measure of upper extremity movement in the home situation. The measure proposed is recordings from Computer Science Applications Inc. accelerometers worn by patients on each forearm, the chest, and the ankle. The properties of this instrument were examined in 2 studies. In the first study, 15-min segments of synchronous accelerometer and videotape data were collected from 9 individuals with stroke and 1 healthy person engaged in their regular activities at home or at a rehabilitation clinic. The videotapes were coded by a panel of observers for the duration of more-impaired arm movement and amount of functional activity. The relationships between the observer and accelerometer data were examined using correlational and regression analyses. In the second study, 3- to 6-day periods of accelerometer data were collected from 11 upper and 9 lower extremity CI therapy patients and 4 persons with stroke from the community before and after treatment or a no-treatment period. Ann use in the home was also measured using the MAL. The reliability, stability, sensitivity, and specificity of the accelerometer recordings were examined, as well their relationship to the MAL. The results indicate that accelerometer recordings provide a highly reliable, stable, and accurate measure of the duration of impaired arm movement that has good sensitivity and specificity with regard to the treatment effect of CI therapy. This new measure makes a start at meeting the need in rehabilitation for objective measures of real-world treatment outcome.

"96","Epistemic motivation and the uses of political knowledge","Researchers have devoted a great deal of attention to how information-processing mechanisms may be responsible for the transformation of political information and predispositions into organized beliefs and political judgments, but they have not examined the possibility that various motivational factors may condition the effects of these informational variables. The goal of the studies reported here was to help fill this gap by exploring the potential role of one of these motivational factors, namely, epistemic motivation, or the degree to which a person is motivated to pursue and rely on knowledge that is clear, unambiguous, and stable. This general hypothesis was tested with regard to three different outcome variables. Study 1 explored the possibility that epistemic motivation would moderate the relationship between expertise and attitude consistency. Study 2 explored epistemic motivation's effects on the relationship between expertise and political information processing. Here, expertise was expected to be more strongly associated with consistency biases in memory for political information among individuals experiencing a high need for closure, given their tendency use pre-existing knowledge as a source of 'ready-made' answers. Finally, Study 3 extended this analysis by looking at the effects of epistemic motivation on the relationship between expertise and the cognitive complexity of their political perceptions. Here, it was expected that the relationship between expertise and complexity would be weaker among individuals under a high need for closure, given their preference for simple, heuristic modes of thought. Support for these predictions was mixed While Study 1 did suggest that expertise and epistemic motivation interact to predict attitude consistency, Studies 2 and 3 failed to support the hypotheses that the need for closure would moderate the relationship between expertise and consistency biases in memory for political information and cognitive complexity, respectively. Both methodological problems-such as the demand characteristics of the materials used in the studies and a reliance on student subjects-and substantive concerns-such as a failure to consider the informational and motivational aspects of political cognition at comparable levels of specificity-may account for these divergent results.

"97","Richard E. Snow's remaking of the concept of aptitude and multidimensional test validity: Introduction to the Special Issue","Richard E. Snow conceived of individuals' performances as the result of a transaction between their aptitudes and the particular characteristics of the situation in which a performance occurred over time. By aptitudes he meant the cognitive, conative, and affective resources that an individual brings to the situation. By situation he meant the characteristics of a particular environment that afforded or impeded--that assisted or constrained--certain course; of goal-directed action for different individuals. In relation to achievement tests, Snow proposed that individuals' test performances emerged from the organization of their demographic background and intellectual history; an ""assembly"" of cognitive, conative, and affective processes needed to more or less effectively respond to a series of situation-embedded test tasks and the ways in which the demand characteristics and opportunities of the tasks were attuned to or mismatched with individuals' aptitude resources. Performance and its determinants were not viewed as static but rather as dynamic processes unfolding over time at the interface of person and situation. From this reasoning and related empirical findings, Snow concluded that a new approach to validating interpretations of achievement test scores was needed.

"99","Does self-serving bias cancel the Barnum effect?","This study examines whether individuals believe in the reality of positive personality traits more readily than negative traits, when these are falsely ascribed to them in a bogus feedback situation. 27 college students first filled out a personality test, then a list of traits (positive, negative and neutral) was presented for them to rate how well each one described their own personality. A seven-point scale was used to assess the perceived accuracy for each supposed trait. The 3 types of statements, demand characteristics, and genders were compared for their effects on perceived accuracy of ascribed traits, using a 3×2×2 mixed ANOVA. The results indicate that the type of trait presented to the participant affected the rating in relative terms, according to the principle of self-serving bias, whereas gender and demand characteristics showed no significant effect. It appears that the self-serving bias is powerful enough to cancel the usual Barnum effect, in which subjects typically show marked gullibility for statements about themselves.

"100","Developing a measure of individual differences in organizational revenge","Developed a measurement, the Organizational Revenge Scale, of the individual differences that contribute to acts of organizational revenge and aggression. This scale was designed to achieve 3 goals: (1) to minimize demand characteristics so that the scale may be useful for personnel selection, (2) to represent a wide range of possible behavioral reactions to organizational injustice, and (3) to represent a range of trust violations committed by organizations that can lead to revenge. Two studies were conducted to reduce the initial 168 items into a 50-item scale containing 2 conceptually distinct subscales, a 19-item Constructive subscale and a 31-item Destructive subscale. Subjects (Ss) in Exp 1 were 198 undergraduates. Study 2 (353 undergraduate Ss) provides evidence for the internal reliability of the overall scale and its subscales and also provides some evidence for the construct validity of the final scale.

The possibility that such self-consciousness might result from contact with peers who are more attentive and critical than those encountered during childhood or adulthood has not been considered. Study 1 tested whether young adults (aged 18–27 yrs), who are not theoretically susceptible to IA, could be made to receive high scores on IA and self-consciousness measures by having them complete a procedure in 1 of 3 laboratory conditions—a critical audience, a noncritical audience, or no audience. Ss in the critical-audience condition received significantly lower IA and self-consciousness scores than Ss in the no-audience condition did. Study 2 tested whether the directions given to Study 1 Ss might have been responsible for the unexpected findings. Results indicated that Ss instructed to give mature-sounding responses received lower IA/self-consciousness scores than did those asked to report their honest opinions. Results indicated that survey measures of IA are subject to demand characteristics and highlighted the need to interpret with caution age differences in IA as traditionally assessed.

Compared with their counterparts, caregiving wives reported higher levels of depression and stress, but similar shared values and closeness. For the 3 factors developed from the Marital Interaction Coding System (Supportive, Facilitative, and Rapport Building), disease status, type of task, and gender interacted significantly. Noncaregiving couples were more interactive overall and expressed more support to each other. Caregiving wives were most facilitative during the planning task, whereas AD husbands were highest on interactions that built rapport (e.g., smiling) during that same task. Caregiving wives actually increased their facilitative behavior from the mealtime to planning task, probably reflecting the increased demand characteristics of the latter.

To investigate one relevant situational variable, 83 young adults approached in a public mail were given the Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (RMAS), by one of two female researchers. One researcher dressed conservatively while the other dressed provocatively; half way through the study the researchers switched clothing to counterbalance any other experimenter effects besides that of clothing. A 2 X 2 between-subjects ANOVA found that: (1)men scored higher than women on the RMAS; (2)both men and women scored higher on the RMAS when the researcher was dressed conservatively than dressed provocatively; (3) this paradoxical effect of researcher's clothing was more pronounced for men's scores than women's. The experimenter effect is interpreted in two ways: (1) the respondents may not have wanted to offend the researcher dressed in provocative clothing or (2) respondents felt more free to share their RMA with the researcher who was dressed conservatively.

"105","Aging and memory: Cognitive and biological perspectives","This chapter first provides brief reviews of the effects of aging on all nonepisodic forms of memory functioning, including the generality, sources, and variability of the effect. A broad perspective on individual differences encompassing demographic, lifestyle, health related, and genetic factors is adopted. Finally, recent observations indicating that a large portion of the age-related variance in memory, other cognitive, and sensory and motor functioning are shared. Extant evidence suggests that age-related deficits in primary memory and various forms of priming are small or nonexistent. For procedural and semantic memory, age-related deficits may or may not be observed depending on various demand characteristics. By contrast, tasks assessing working memory and episodic memory typically exhibit a marked performance deterioration from early to late adulthood. It is suggested that future attempts to increase knowledge on adult life span changes in memory functioning may profit from combining various biological indicators at different analytical levels as well as from combining various biological parameters with other factors known to produce systematic performance variation.

"106","Observational goals and behavior unitization: A reexamination","In two studies, it was found that perceivers with different observational goals-learning an actor's task forming an impression of her, or no specific goal-picked up qualitatively different information while viewing the actor's ongoing behavior. Because a between-subjects design and analysis was used, the results rule out a demand-characteristics interpretation that may explain a similar finding in earlier research. It was also found that the explicit goal of learning a task or forming an impression (relative to having no specific goal) led to the selection of less information overall from the observed behavior. Finally, in contrast to previous work on this topic, the authors found that the goal of learning a task did not lead perceivers to select more information than did the goal of forming an impression. Implications of these findings and future research possibilities are discussed. (PsycInfo (2022) Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)","0","2","N/A","N/A",NA,"Lassiter, G.

"107","Concurrent mobile (cellular) phone use and driving performance: Task demand characteristics and compensatory processes","This paper reports a simulator-based study of the effects of mobile phone use on driving performance. The 37 participants (13 male, 17 female, mean= 26.93 years of age) completed four simulated drives using the The Aston Driving Simulator (ADS). Changes in heart rate indicated that mobile phone use increases the cognitive demand experienced by drivers with, it is argued, consequent reduction in safety margins. However, experimental results also suggested that participants engaged in a process of risk compensation, with driving speed being slower at times of mobile phone conversation while the number of off-road excursions (OFFS) and collisions remained stable. There also was some evidence that the use of a hand-held mobile phone (when compared to a hands-free system) was associated with poorer driving performance. Implications for ""real world' driving are considered.

After a 2-day delay, participants were interviewed with free recall and recognition questions administered by either the same or a different interviewer. Results from day 1 replicate previous findings with levels of recall and resistance to suggestibility increasing with age. Counter to predictions, correct recognition performance on day 2 was greater for some participants interviewed by the same as opposed to a different interviewer, and incorrect recognition was greater for all groups of participants for those interviewed by a different as opposed to the same interviewer. Results are discussed in terms of the role of context dependence on memory performance.

The issues considered are administration, participant characteristics, measurement, mood quality, and demand characteristics. The author proposes a broad framework for the future investigation of mood induction procedures for children that includes comparative outcome studies, parametric studies, and more comprehensive mood measurement. Several issues are outlined that investigators might consider when designing experiments to test the generality of negative mood induction studies to clinical depression, including specificity or comorbidity, intensity or severity, age, and sex.

Keysar, 1994) is actually an interesting and perplexing phenomenon, or whether readers are simply perplexed when protagonists in stories behave uncooperatively or irrationally. In this commentary, Gerrig et al highlight data from their original experiments that were not addressed by Keysar (see record 2000-03791-004). Gerrig et al suggest that serious demand characteristics, rather than illusory transparency, explain participants' greatly varying judgments across experiments. They also reiterate their concern that, with respect to expectations of cooperative and rational behavior, the speakers in Keysar's scenarios are behaving quite badly. It is questionable whether important theoretical generalizations can or should be drawn from this paradigm.

"113","The relation between stereotyping and prejudice: Measures of newly formed automatic associations","A prevailing assumption in social psychological theory, that stereotypes (beliefs about the traits typical of members of a group) and prejudice (the general evaluative bias toward a group) are redundant constructs, is challenged experimentally. Eight methodological studies are carried out to identify effective procedures for the creation and assessment of stereotypes of, and prejudice toward, novel (fictitious) groups. A supraliminal semantic priming procedure, involving the repeated visual pairings of adjectives with group exemplar names, proved highly effective in inducing stereotypes and prejudice when an Implicit Association Test (IAT) procedure was used to assess these new biases. The IAT is effective at measuring automatic associations, i.e., those that are beyond the conscious control of the holder. Consequently, the biases measured in this manner are not confounded by response biases engendered by demand characteristics or social desirability. Further, these methods demonstrate that intergroup biases can be learned and exhibited outside of conscious control. The ninth and final study addressed directly the relation between stereotyping and prejudice by creating biases that are based on either stereotypes or prejudice, challenging these biases with countervailing stereotypes, and assessing the differential impact of the countervalent stereotypes. Consistent with a cross-resonance theory, which holds that affect-based biases will be changed more by cognitive challenges and vice versa for cognition-based biases, results indicate that the countervalent stereotypes have a greater impact on prejudice-based biases than they do on stereotype-based biases. This supports the assertion that stereotyping and prejudice are not redundant, but rather are distinct constructs. However, it does appear that there is considerable overlap between stereotypes and prejudice, and that changing stereotypes can be an effective method for reducing prejudice.

"115","Compliance after threat: Self-affirmation or self-presentation?","People become more likely to comply with the wishes of others after their self-concepts have been threatened. C. M. Steele (1975) suggested that the function of compliance in this context is to restore the integrity of the self-concept. An alternative interpretation is that threats merely motivate people to make positive impressions on others. To examine these two possibilities, the authors manipulated the type of threat to the self (private vs public) and of the type of compliance opportunity (private vs public) independently (Study 1). Under three out of four conditions, threats increased compliance. Compliance was no different from the no-threat control when the threat was private and the opportunity was public. This interactional pattern suggested that both self-affirmation and self-presentation motives contributed to compliance. A simulation study ruled out demand characteristics and other intuitions concerning social influence as explanations of these findings (Study 2).

"116","Racial and ethnic identity development in biracial people","Although this country has always had a history of racial mixture, more and more people are defining themselves multiracially than ever before (Root, 1996). This study explored several aspects of multiracial identity. First, within a college population 159 surveys were administered to students between the ages of 18 and 36 to explore the relationship between one's personal ethnic identity and that of one's ancestors. Over seventeen percent of respondents reported having at least one relative in the last four generations who was described as racially different than other relatives. Only a third of these respondents identified themselves as multiracial. Biracial people who identified themselves as monoracial despite having parents of two different racial groups were interviewed to understand the process of their identity formation. Five of the sixteen people interviewed identified monoracially. Most of those who identified monoracially (all identified with their nonWhite reference group) stated that affiliating themselves with their nonWhite culture was siding with the ""right"" side given the history of oppression in this country against people of color. Other reasons included contact with only one parent, and greater simplicity in reporting status. Second, multiracial participants were interviewed to ascertain the ways in which they came to terms with their racial and ethnic identities. Root's (1996) description of four coping mechanisms were tested. While at least a few examples were found to support all of Root's proposed constructs, participants were most likely to identify as either monoracial or multiracial. Interviews were conducted with sixteen people to attempt to understand the influences on ethnic and racial identity formation. Family appeared to be the largest contributor to ethnic-racial identity development among biracial individuals. Other important influences included peers, messages specific to ethnic and racial identity, community, school, history, language, and phenotype. Limitations to this study were related to sampling. Geographical diversity of participants was lacking, and their were large age differences between respondents. Also, participants had relatively high levels of education. Responses by participants may have also been affected by demand characteristics of the interview process. Further research could address limitations and build upon the findings of the current study.

"117","Test of a human adjunctive behavior protocol with facial pain and no-pain subjects","Empirical reports suggest that excessive behavioral adjuncts develop in conjunction with fixed-time stimulus presentation. Reductions in neurophysiological indicators of stress in animals that engage in adjunctive behaviors suggest an adaptive coping component to the phenomenon. A second literature suggests that oral habits (e.g., teeth clenching) may be behavioral mediators linking stress to the development of facial pain. It is the intent of this study to bridge these two literatures to provide one explanation as to how maladaptive oral habits develop and are maintained despite painful consequences. It is possible that oral adjunctive, or schedule-induced behaviors, develop as a coping strategy that presumably reduces negative arousal engendered by fixed time (FT) schedules. The aim of this study was to develop a methodologically sound adjunctive behavior research protocol in order to improve the applicability of the model with human subjects. An adjunctive behavior protocol termed the Schedule-Controlled Narrative (SCN) was designed and tested with a two-part study. The first study was a preliminary test of methodological design issues (i.e., demand characteristics) utilizing predominantly no-pain subjects; the second study compared twenty facial pain and eighteen no-pain female subjects. The SCN consists of a non-eventful adaptation period (10 minutes) followed by an audiotaped mystery story with the ending deleted, played during the baseline (i.e., second) phase. Paired comparison t-tests revealed that mean masseter EMG was higher in the first 20 seconds of the post-stimulus interval relative to the remaining 40 seconds in the interval for 9 of the 20 TMD subjects (45%) and 3 of the 18 no-pain subjects (16%). These findings are important because it has been demonstrated in the animal literature that schedule-induced behavior, a subset of adjunctive behaviors, displays a temporal effect; behavior occurs at a greater rate in the initial post-stimulus interval relative to the remaining inter-stimulus interval. Taken together, the present results suggest that the SCN is a methodologically sound human adjunctive behavior task. Moreover, the adjunctive behavior literature may provide one explanation as to how oral habits develop and are maintained in TMD patients despite their painful consequences.

Kosslyn (record 1999-11569-001) who convincingly demonstrate structural and search properties of images, dismissing arguments concerning tacit knowledge, demand characteristics, and E bias. This is important because imagery is a cognitive tool for dealing with absence (i.e., filling in parts that are occluded, recalling scenes and objects no longer in view, simulating how events will unfold over time.) Thus, imagery is a valuable tool, and its value is a function of its degree of similarity to the real thing.

"120","Goal and reward effects on individual and group performance of a simulated industrial task","Goal setting has been described as an effective methodology for increasing worker productivity, but there has been little research on whether goal effects are similar for individuals and work teams. The present study was designed to determine whether goal levels, functioning as discriminative stimuli, under reward/no reward conditions, would increase productivity in a simulated manufacturing situation. A total of 180 subjects were randomly assigned to 12 groups in a 2 x 3 x 2 factorial design. Subjects were required to produce 16-bead, multicolored bracelets to match a model. Three factors constituted the independent variables in this study: reward condition (pay or no pay), goal level (no goal, easy goal, hard goal), and work condition (individual or team condition). Reward consisted of a $0.25 payment per bracelet per person involved in its production. Mean number of bracelets produced in one 30-minute session served as the dependent measure. The analysis of the productivity data revealed no significant difference between reward and no reward; a marginally significant difference (p &lt;.05) across goal levels; and a significant difference (p &lt;. 01) between team and individual work contexts. Group and individual performance was similar at each goal level under the no reward condition but groups performed best with easy goals while individuals performed best with hard goals when a reward was offered. However, there were no statistically reliable interaction effects. Across all goal levels, and in both the reward and the no reward situations, the work teams out produced the &amp;ldquo;work alone&amp;rdquo; workers. The teams produced 30&amp;ndash;33% more units per 30-minute work period, but, at an undesirable 400% increased cost in the reward condition. The large, but not statistically reliable difference between group and individual responses to goals under reward conditions warrants further research. In the present study, the most significant practical finding was that bracelet productivity increased marginally but not similarly for both teams and individuals as goal difficulty went up regardless of monetary reward. Such productivity increases could be attributable to: (a) the demand characteristics of the work situation; (b) the discriminative properties (and secondary reinforcement characteristics) of the productivity goals; and, (c) the feedback from the experimenter (supervisor) as to the &amp;ldquo;correctness&amp;rdquo; of each unit manufactured.

"121","The perceived impact of counseling involving dream interpretation for women exploring their sexual orientation","This study employed a qualitative design to examine the perceived effects of dream interpretation and the counseling process in general for five women (18 or older) who were exploring their sexual orientation. Participants were given 3 quantitative measures prior to counseling and one week after termination of counseling: the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), the Attitudes Toward Lesbians (ATL) scale, and a self-description of sexual orientation measure (SOM) created for this study. Clients also were asked to complete a Gains from Dream Interpretation Questionnaire at the end of sessions involving dream interpretation. For data analysis, each individual's pre- and post-counseling scores on the BSI, ATL and SOM were descriptively compared. One week after termination, participants met with the therapist they did NOT have counseling with to complete the follow-up interview, in which they were asked to respond to a variety of open-ended questions about the experience of counseling and dream interpretation. The interview was audio-taped and responses to questions were transcribed. Categories were developed using the Consensual Qualitative Research method. Findings showed no significant overall changes in quantitative measures of internalized homophobia or identification of sexual orientation. The three of the five clients who had above average symptomatology before counseling showed a significant decrease in reported symptomatology, so that all five were in the normal range after treatment. Qualitatively, clients typically (3 of 5) reported changes in their relationships, had become more self-aware, and felt more accepting of their sexual orientation after counseling. In the follow-up interviews, clients indicated helpful/unhelpful aspects of counseling and of dream interpretation, and their general sense of the impact of counseling involving dream interpretation on their sexual orientation. All clients reported that counseling was helpful due to a positive relationship that was supportive and affirming and because they felt their counselors' sexual orientation allowed them to understand and relate to clients. Dream interpretation was helpful in that clients gained insight through the process and their counselors' collaboration. All five clients found it helpful that counseling permitted exploration of and increased awareness of sexuality issues and that dream interpretation related to increased acceptance of their sexual orientation. Limitations to the findings of the study include limited generalizability due to heterogeneity of a sample that was very small and the potential of demand characteristics influencing the results.

"122","The item and list methods of directed forgetting: Test differences and the role of demand characteristics","In directed forgetting (DF), the item method presents instructions to remember or to forget individual items, whereas the list method presents a single mid-list instruction to forget the first half of the list. This study compared the impact of the 2 methods for conducting DF experiments on several tests of memory, and examined whether demand characteristics play any role in DF effects. 24 Ss were assigned to each testing condition. Initial free recall was better for remember (R) words than for forget (F) words under both methods. Offered $.50 for each additional F word, Ss could recall almost no more items, eliminating a demand characteristics explanation. On a yes/no recognition test, only the item method showed DF. Retrospective instruction identification was good except for F words under the list method, where performance was at chance. There was no evidence of speed-accuracy tradeoff on the recognition or instruction identification tests. These results bring together the major findings concerning DF and support a method-based theoretical distinction.

In fact, Ss sometimes claim to remember which of two speakers said the critical lures. The authors examined whether this finding could be accounted for by demand characteristics. If Ss' willingness to make source attributions to critical lures reflects experimental demand, one would predict that Ss should be willing to change and should have little confidence in these attributions. Results showed that Ss made more attributions, were less likely to change their attributions, and were more confident in their attributions for critical lures than for unrelated distractors. Ss had even more confidence in the attributions that they made for words that had actually been presented, and they were even less likely to change these attributions. These findings suggest that false memories are quite compelling but that they are also subtly different from true memories.

A. Quattrone, 1982) by manipulating the presence-absence of a constrained essay, the participants' accountability, and the applicability of the available information. A constrained essay was neither necessary nor sufficient to anchor a judgment. When no essay was circulated, no OAB occurred in the cases of accountability or of inapplicability (Studies 1 and 2). When the essay was provided, however, both accountability and inapplicability were needed to eliminate the OAB (Studies 2 and 3). These findings did not result from conversational rules or demand characteristics. They illustrate that people control the expression of a judgment made under uncertainty; people express the judgment to the extent they feel entitled to do so. The results are discussed in the wider context of current multistage models of the dispositional inference process.

"125","Children's memory for a traumatic event after one year: An examination of individual differences and recall, suggestibility, and narrative consistency","This study explores the effects of individual difference variables on children's recall, suggestibility and narrative consistency when they discuss traumatic events. Also explored was the effect of question type on reporting accuracy. It was expected that some individual difference variables, such as self concept and parenting style, would be associated with differences in recall, suggestibility and narrative consistency, and that certain types of questions would elicit more accurate responses than others. Participants were 3 to 7 year-olds who sustained facial lacerations requiring minor medical emergency treatment. The children were interviewed about their surgeries and accidents a few days after the events and 6-weeks and 1-year later. The interviews employed a hierarchically-designed protocol which began with general probes followed by more specific questions. A number of individual difference measures were administered to the children and their parents at the time of the first two interviews so that associations between differences between children and reports of the event could be studied. The results support the hypothesis that there are individual difference variables that may help to explain some of the variability in children's recall and suggestibility. Younger children with poorer receptive language skills and children of more traditional parents recalled less total information about their surgeries after one year. This suggests that retrieval after a delay may depend on linguistic sophistication and, perhaps, on a child's confidence in his/her own interpretation of events. Child traditionalism, achievement-motivation and social avoidance were found to protect children from suggestibility only at the initial interview. It is theorized that it is the demand characteristics of the interview situation, rather than memory for the event, that causes certain children to respond differently to suggestive questions. This study provides support for the hypothesis that some questions are likely to yield more accurate information than others. Children provided significantly more correct information about actions that occurred than about statements that were made during the event. Further study is need to determine what type of suggestive questions are most difficult for children, and what factors might effect narrative consistency for traumatic events. Implications for children's court testimony are discussed.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 1979-28678-001.) Reviews research on the relationship between self-perceptions and evaluations from other people. Studies of naturalistic interactions indicate that people's self-perceptions agree substantially with the way they perceive themselves as being viewed by others. However, there is no consistent agreement between people's self-perceptions and how they are actually viewed by others. There is no clear indication that self-evaluations are influenced by the feedback received from others in naturally occurring situations. When feedback from others is manipulated experimentally, self-perceptions are usually changed. However, methodological limitations such as the questionable external validity and strong demand characteristics of the experimental situations employed make the significance of these findings unclear. The available evidence is examined within a framework that considers the transmission, processing, and evaluation of judgments from others. Other means by which interaction may influence self-perceptions aside from direct evaluative feedback are considered.

"127","Effects of rational emotive behavior training on educators' beliefs, well-being, and stress. (irrational beliefs, cognition)","Rational-emotive behavior therapy (REBT) theorizes that emotions are derived from cognitions. REBT research has focused on effectiveness; less has been directed at psychoeducational variants and component efficacy. Progress regarding effectiveness is slow, resulting from conceptual and methodological flaws (Haaga, Dryden &amp; Dancy, 1991). The present study examined the effects of psychoeducational rational-emotive behavior training on educators by teaching them to dispute different irrational beliefs. Significant changes over time and among conditions were predicted. Reductions in self-reported irrational beliefs, and stress/burnout, were hypothesized. Improved self-reported general well-being was hypothesized. Ellis, hypothesis that all irrational beliefs derive from ""demands,"" has lacked empirical support, and was explored as a research question. A 3 x (3) split-plot design was employed for the hypotheses; a 4 x (3) split-plot design was employed for the research question. One hundred thirty participants were assigned by district into six conditions: four REBT (demandingness, awfulizing, low frustration tolerance, human worth rating), one relaxation/assertiveness training, and one wait-list control. Twelve-hour curricula focused exclusively on disputing one irrational belief category in the demandingness, awfulizing, frustration tolerance, or human worth rating training conditions, or was devoted exclusively to relaxation and assertiveness training. Those educators wait-listed received no training or contact with the investigator. Results supported reductions in educators' irrational beliefs. Little support was provided for improved feelings of general well-being. No support was found for decreased levels of experienced stress/burnout. The research question results indicated that regardless of which irrational belief was identified and disputed, educators' irrational thinking decreased in general. Implications of psychoeducational rational-emotive behavior training on educators' cognitions, affect, and stress/burnout were discussed. Methodological limitations included restricted range of the sample, randomization difficulties, experimenter bias, demand characteristics, exclusive and self-report use. Recommendations offered for future studies included: (1) increased control of confounding variables such as age, religion, ethnicity, teaching experience, (2) repetition with anxious, depressed, or otherwise distressed samples, (3) longer, more intensive training, (4) additional empirical investigation of Ellis' rational emotive behavior theory and mechanisms of change.

Over 200 magazine advertisements were analyzed according to E. Goffman's (1976) rubrics of licensed withdrawal, function ranking, relative size, ritualization of subordination, feminine touch, and the family. Results indicated that the ads from White-oriented magazines were characterized by relatively frequent displays of licensed withdrawal and ritualization of subordination. Those aimed at African Americans, however, were characterized by more frequent portrayals of the family. Almost half of each sample were classified into an ""other"" category which followed none of Goffman's rubrics. Results are discussed in terms of the demand characteristics implicit in gender advertisements and in terms of cultural differences in gender role expectations.

"129","Trauma, memory, and clinical practice","We summarize here the available information on trauma and memory for the practicing clinician. We acknowledge several seemingly undeniable facts. Clinicians working with children or adults who have experienced trauma must strive to create a therapeutic environment that supports the recollection and psychological processing of the impact and meaning of that trauma. Yet therapy, by virtue of its demand characteristics, and the trust and relative power conferred upon the psychotherapist, can inadvertently confound memory through inadequate attention to its intrinsic suggestive influences. Further, although the literal accuracy of all aspects of memories may not be of singular importance in the consultation room, the majority of therapists agree that it is harmful for patients to have false beliefs that they were abused or maltreated. In this regard, clinicians should be mindful that there are implications for what patients recall and talk about in therapy. Patient psychological status, family relationships, and legal cases may be affected by what is remembered or believed to be true or false.

Exp 2, using 39 Ss, replicated and extended Exp 1 through application of the real-simulating paradigm. Across the 2 experiments, there was no difference in the performance of Ss who learned the word list either before or during hypnosis.

Results indicate that intervention group men and women became more empathic toward the victim than the control group, postintervention. Within the intervention group, men changed more in their attitudes toward women postintervention than did women. In addition to positive attitude change, results with the date-rape scenarios suggested that intervention-group men became more certain of their definitions of rape situations postintervention. Prior to the intervention, women were generally more certain of their definitions than were men, with intervention-group men approximating women's responses postintervention.

"132","Improving the accuracy of self-reports of adherence","Evaluated the influence of 3 experimenter demands—demand for adherence, demand for accurate reports, and demand for accurate reports combined with a prompted recall strategy—on the accuracy of self-reports of adherence to a week-long prescribed regimen of twice-daily telephone calls. Participants were 45 undergraduate students. Ss were informed that the study was about how cognitions influence behavior, specifically whether urges to miss class influenced subsequent class attendance. A telephone call regimen was ""prescribed"" that involved each S making 2 calls per day. Ss were divided into 3 groups, adherence demand (ADH), accuracy demand (ACC), and accuracy demand/prompted recall (ADP). Results show that all groups on average overreported adherence. The ADH group reported they had made 123% of the calls they had actually made; 69% of Ss in this group overreported adherence. The ACC group reported they had made 112% of calls made; 53% overreported. The ADP group reported they had made 107% of their calls; 40% overreported. Demand characteristics and the prompted recall strategy influenced the accuracy of self-reports. Overreporting may be attributable to both experimenter demands and recall errors.

"133","The effectiveness of warning signs in hazardous work places: Cognitive and social determinants","Responses of 40 blue-collar workers and 44 college students (aged 15–44 yrs) to 5 industrial warning signs were measured to investigate the extent to which components (alerting word, statements of the hazard, consequences, and instructions of how to avoid the hazard) determine estimated sign effectiveness and behavioural intentions of compliance. Each sign was presented in 5 versions; the original (which in each case omitted one or more of the components), a ""full"" version in which missing components were generated and inserted, and versions omitting, in turn, the hazard, consequences, and instructions statements. Previous findings concerning the importance of the alerting signal word were supported. When signs were seen singly there was no tendency for versions with components missing to be rated as poorer. Only when all versions were seen together was the ""full"" version ranked as being better, a result which is taken as reflecting the demand characteristics of the method. The results argue against strict adherence to a formula requiring specified components in a sign. Data also supported the third person effect, indicating that respondents considered others to be more vulnerable to the hazard and less likely to comply with the sign than they themselves. The finding that social factors are of considerable importance in sign compliance is discussed.

This issue is important because external validity may be threatened when researchers take samples from university participant pools. In the present study, point-of-time effects were investigated via measures of procrastination, motivation, locus of control, and cued recall. The findings suggest that slight differences exist between early and late volunteers on some measures of personality and motivation; however, there were no point-of-time effects for cued recall. The data indicate that if performance-based measures (e.g., cued recall) are under investigation, potential differences in personality and motivation may be attenuated because of the demand characteristics of laboratory settings.

"138","The effects of consistency, previous relationship, and the woman's reaction on judgments of sexual harassment: A factorial survey approach","Sexual harassment continues to be a pervasive and costly problem for organizations today. In addition, defining and understanding sexual harassment, particularly that creating a ""hostile environment"" has been quite difficult due to its subjective nature. A personal characteristic that appears to have a substantial impact on the perception of sexual harassment is gender (Culbertson &amp; Rosenfeld, 1993; Gutek, 1985; Thacker &amp; Gohmann, 1992). The present study attempted to provide better understanding of gender-based differences in judgements of sexual harassment by examining whether certain elements of the situation might lead to more agreement between men and women. It was hypothesized that under certain situations (when the man's actions were consistent, when the previous relationship was romantic, when the woman did not react negatively in the past) sexual harassment judgements made by men and women may come closer to agreement. Three hundred sixty students read scenarios describing an interaction between a man and a woman and then made three judgments regarding the behavior described: the severity of the harassment, who was responsible for the interaction, and the likelihood that the behavior would have actually occurred. The study used a factorial survey design in which each participant only responded to a subset of the total number of possible scenarios, thereby minimizing the effect of demand characteristics. Regarding the consistency of the man's actions, a main effect was found for the judgement of sexual harassment severity but not for the other two judgments. Interestingly, judgments of sexual harassment severity were significantly higher when consistency was described as moderate as opposed to high. The interaction was perceived as being less harassing, less the man's responsibility and more likely to have occurred when the previous relationship between the two individuals was described either as being romantic or when the woman was described as reacting in a manner that did not clearly convey her disapproval of the man's actions towards her. Gender-based agreement in the sexual harassment judgments was not found to be created by the inclusion of certain situational variables, as predicted. However, men and women appeared to use the situational information in a similar manner to make their decisions about sexual harassment. Directions for future research, the applicability of the findings to the relations between men and women in the workplace, and implications for organizations attempting to minimize the effects of sexual harassment are discussed.

"139","Predictors of agoraphobic avoidance: A biopsychosocial model of personality risk factors","In an attempt to account for the gender difference in the prevalence of panic disorder with agoraphobia, an integrated theoretical model of agoraphobia is proposed that incorporates biological/developmental markers of anxiety proneness, personality risk factors, and socialization variables. This model was tested in two phases. In phase I, the relations among the personality traits of neuroticism, introversion, avoidant and dependent personality, anxiety sensitivity, avoidance coping styles, and instrumentality, and the severity of agoraphobic avoidance were tested using structural equation modeling. The results provide direct support for empirical associations between dispositional measures and avoidance, and the plausibility of the model, and indirect support for the proposed theory of agoraphobia. In phase II, the effects of personality and social demand characteristics on avoidance behavior were examined in an experimental design using an approach-avoidance task that involved attending to emotionally arousing visual stimuli under conditions of high or low social demand for approach behavior. The picture-viewing task was unsuccessful in activating agoraphobic avoidance tendencies, however, evidence of a memory bias for affectively unpleasant and arousing pictures emerged.

However, one set indicates that a low need for cognition is associated with greater thought-induced attitude polarization (C. Leone and E. Ensley; 1986), whereas the other set indicates that a high need for cognition is associated with greater thought-induced attitude polarization (D. Lassiter et al; 1996). To provide a direct test of a demand characteristics interpretation of Lassiter et al, the present study assessed participants beliefs about how they would respond if they were actually taking part in the aforementioned studies. 106 undergraduate students volunteered to take part in the experiment. The simulation data indicate that high (relative to low) need-for-cognition individuals tend to believe that they will depolarize their attitudes in these kinds of experiments. Thus, although the Lassiter et al results, which challenge the only previous finding on this topic, cannot be explained by a demand-characteristics interpretation, perhaps the original Leone and Ensley data can.

The Sexual Social Desirability Scale (M. McGrath et al, 1990) measures attitudes about sex, sexual activities, and intimate sexual relationships. CMs and NSOs attributed more positive characteristics to themselves than did controls. CMs denied more negative characteristics than did the controls and NSOs. Even CMs asked to fake good did not differ in denial from CMs who answered anonymously or those in assessment for parole. For CMs, denial was not affected by demand characteristics. The Empathy scale (M. McGrath and R. Konopasky, 1995) tested for lack of empathy specific to sexual abuse victims and general lack of empathy. CMs showed less sexual abuse empathy than controls. In contrast, CMs' scores of general empathy equaled controls'. The Child Molester Scale (S. Cann et al, 1995) was developed to reduce the effects of socially desirable responding. CMs assessed for parole reported more cognitive distortions regarding adult–child sexual activity than did controls but not less than NSOs. The 3 tests were significantly correlated.

Forensic high points resembled outpatient profiles but not the MMPI-2 psychiatric sample and shared only code type 13/31 with the normative sample. The most common 2-point code type for males was 13/31, followed by 12/21 and 23/32, and for females was 13/31, followed by 23/32 and 12/21. 50% of the forensic sample were code type 13/31, 12/21, or 23/32. Validity measures suggested possible malingering on approximately 20–30% of the profiles but the majority of profiles were valid. Validity problems discussed include attorney coaching and the congruence of plaintiff personality characteristics with the demand characteristics of litigation.

"147","Would a pill placebo have redeemed project MATCH?","Posted 03/22/1997. In attempting to make the case for a pill-placebo case management group in psychotherapy evaluative research, Don Klein (see record 2006-04139-001) provides an admirably readable potpourri of observations on controls in treatment outcome research. Klein's thoughts appear particularly germane to one the major disappointments of NIAAA's Project MATCH study: In the absence of a convincing, nonreactive placebo condition, the Project MATCH research group could not gauge the true effectiveness of any of the three very carefully wrought psychosocial treatment options to which its 1,600 alcoholic subjects were exposed. An effective, gold placebo might have yielded a different outcome, although precisely how--and whether--a pill placebo might have influenced this outcome for the better still remains unclear.

"148","The use of pill placebo as a control strategy in the evaluation of psychotherapy: Reply to Klein","Posted 09/22/1997. Klein (see record 2006-04139-001) asserts that pill-placebo conditions are a necessary part of the evaluation of psychotherapy, regardless of whether a pharmacotherapy is evaluated as a part of the study in question. Although Klein raises a number of worthwhile points about treatment evaluation, this conclusion is open to question from multiple perspectives. In this response, Klein's assertion is considered in the light of (a) Klein's insistence that medically responsive patients constitute the appropriate population for study, (b) the idealization of double-blind pill placebo as a control strategy, and (c) issues in the development of psychological placebo control conditions.

Klein's (see record 2006-04139-001) arguments for the use of pill-placebo control conditions in psychotherapy research have merit, particularly in regard to a variety of important research questions facing those concerned with public health issues. There are, however, a number of potential situations in which other kinds of designs not involving a pill-placebo control might be more appropriate. Moreover, there are examples of research in which credible nonspecific psychological treatment conditions have been used successfully, and I propose that further use of these control conditions be considered as well.

"150","Control groups in pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy evaluations","Posted 09/22/1997. Whether placebos should be included in evaluative therapeutic research remains controversial. Some argue that placebos should be abandoned on pragmatic and ethical grounds and replaced with comparative trials against known effective agents (K. F. Rothman &amp; K. D. Michels, 1994). However, placebo controls are essential if causal attribution regarding characteristic features is to be made. This methodology also assures that pragmatic therapeutic goals are met. An algebraic model is presented to demonstrate the critical importance of placebos in controlling for demand characteristics and spontaneous remission. The inherent difficulty in designing psychological placebos by fiat and the inadequacy of wait-list controls are addressed. The model demonstrates that inclusion of a pill-placebo group may be the optimal controlled design in psychotherapy as well as pharmacotherapy research and argues for collaborative psychotherapy pharmacotherapy research programs.

Collaterals' awareness of nonalcohol-related levels was also examined. The best agreement occurred for reports from alcohol abusers' spouses who were fairly confident about the information provided. For all variables, some proportion of collaterals respond to demand characteristics of the interview by providing very specific information about Ss' behavior yet admit to being unsure of this information. The results show that collaterals who are fairly sure of the information they provide are the preferred informants to corroborate alcohol abusers' reports of drinking and related behaviors. In some cases the best collaterals are spouses who are fairly sure of the information they reported. It is also recommended that treatment outcome studies should accept reports only from collaterals who are confident about the information they report.

D. Mayer et al (1990) condition. Demand characteristics were controlled by the use of hypothesis-naive experimenters and limited debriefing to minimize the seepage of the experimental hypothesis into the targeted S pool. Mood-congruent recall was not observed at a statistically significant level in this experiment. The most interesting finding was evidence which indicated that the mood inductions altered both degrees of pleasure and arousal. This finding suggests that the 2 dimensions have been confounded in previous research. These results, once again, bring into question the validity of the mood congruency effect.

"154","Developmental changes in the sequential behavior of interacting timber wolf pups","Used information statistics to quantify first-order sequential dependencies in the social behavior of 2 sibling wolf pups. Sequential dependencies in the pups' behavior increased between the 1st sample (S1: 18-32 days of age) and 2 later samples taken from 34-53 days (S2) and 64-106 days (S3) of age. The authors relate these findings to changes in the importance and style of interactions. At S1, social co-actions primarily involved mutual mouthing and pushing. At S2, when interactions frequently became aggressive, the pups were most responsive to the actions of their partner and tail-raising predicted biting. By S3, the pups were primarily engaged in play-chasing, were less attentive to the specific actions of their partner, and no longer preceded biting with tail-raising. These results illustrate the importance of considering demand characteristics in distinguishing capabilities from performance, and suggest that changing social organization may underlie developmental changes in behavior and the growth of control over expressive displays.

It is argued that investigations of the relationships between amount of therapy and subsequent outcome adjusted by such patient characteristics as diagnosis, indicators of illness chronicity and severity, and social support markers are well suited to these settings. In addition, research on the effectiveness of treatment guidelines, treatment manuals, alternative therapies, and alternatives to therapy, is likely to be conducted in these companies resulting in potentially important applied results. Investigations dealing with the selection and training of therapists and care managers would seem to be particularly relevant in managed care. Problems associated with the conduct of research in these settings are presented, including lack of experimental control, demand characteristics, and the effects of business decisions on the collection and dissemination of data. It is concluded that managed health care organizations will be an important future source of naturalistic studies on the effects of psychotherapy.

"159","False memories: Memory process or demand characteristics?","Recently there has been a large debate as to the validity of false memories (memories for events that never actually occurred). The current study attempted to determine the robustness of the false memory phenomenon as well as attempting to differentiate between two causes of the false memory effect (memory processes or subjects' expectations) by using several methods to provide converging evidence. In each experiment subjects studied several word lists. Each list was composed of associates of one nonpresented word (i.e., a critical lure). Results of Experiment 1 revealed a false memory effect with both recall and recognition and subjects were very confident that the critical lures appeared on the study list. In Experiment 2, the list words were presented in both an auditory and visual format. Results of Experiment 2 replicated the false memory effect and revealed that subjects attributed the critical lures to a particular modality. In Experiment 3 subjects were presented with the list items and were asked to try to identify the critical lures. Experiment 3 showed that subjects were able to identify the critical lures quite easily, but at a rate much higher than the size of the false memory effect found in free recall. This shows that the false memory effect is not solely due to demand characteristics. Experiment 4 used a warning to further rule out demand characteristics and used both extra-and intra-category distractors on the final recognition test in order to control for a possible testing strategy. Experiment 4 also required subjects to make ""remember""/""know"" judgments concerning all recognized items. There was no effect of warning with the accuracy data alone. However, without a warning subjects tended to ""know"" that the critical lures were presented while those subjects who received a warning claimed to ""remember"" the critical lures. Results indicate that the false memory effect is due to a memory process involving the nonpresented items.

"160","Multiple personality: Fantasy proneness, demand characteristics, and indirect communication","An etiology is proposed for multiple personality disorder (MPD) without recourse to dissociated early trauma. MPD may be generated by the interaction of specific cognitive abilities associated with extreme hypnotic susceptibility and fantasy proneness with therapist demand characteristics associated with a belief in the early traumatic origins of MPD. The patient's capacity for segmented, absorbed consciousness; highly uncritical vivid fantasy; and relative secretiveness about fantasy experience matches the therapist's expectations of a mistrustful patient concealing shameful early trauma in colorful dissociated reenactments. The necessity to earn trust pulls for credulity; the expectation of concealment pulls for probing suggestive therapeutic techniques. Dramatic representation of apparent early abuse is conceptualized as an indirect commentary on the patient's current therapeutic experience.

Five experiments offer converging evidence that suspicion triggers active, sophisticated attributional thinking. These studies examined participants' spontaneous thoughts and attributional analyses in the context of high-constraint or ulterior-motives conditions. The studies (a) suggest that high-constraint information and ulterior-motive information have divergent effects on perceivers early in the inference process, (b) demonstrate the correspondence bias in instances in which demand characteristics are minimized, and (c) show that the effects of suspicion can endure across targets and contexts. The implications of these results for current models of the correspondence bias and the dispositional inference process, and suggestions for a revised model, are discussed.

Undergraduates (6 men, 6 women) were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatments. The experimental manipulation of ITL beliefs appeared successful for the RTL and RTL counter-demand conditions. Demand characteristics did not seem to affect task ANX for the RTL statements; results were less clear for the ITL statements. Task ANX was lower in the RTL and RTL counter-demand conditions than in the ITL and neutral conditions, suggesting that RTL statements reduce ANX. The less conclusive results for the ITL statements may have been due to failure to manipulate ITL beliefs effectively. Increased ANX led to increased ITL beliefs, suggesting that the relationship between ITL beliefs and ANX may be reciprocal.

Heshka's (see record 1994-33974-001) critical analysis of studies supporting the claim of psychosomatic theory that obese people eat more than nonobese people in response to emotional stress. Their contention that the obese overreport emotional eating as a result of effects of demand characteristics, social desirability, and interpersonal expectancies is questioned. It is actually more plausible that obese Ss would underreport emotional eating. Allison and Heshka's contention that a high correlation between a measurement instrument and a measure of social desirability invalidates that measurement instrument is also disputed. Reasons why emotional eating explains so little of the variance in weight gain and obesity are elucidated.

"175","""I don't know"": Resistance or groping for words? The construction of analytic subjectivity","Discusses 4 theoretical assumptions that make up therapists' preconceptions about the nature of psychological distress: (1) it is better to know than not to know, (2) it is important to observe and reflect on oneself, (3) there is more to the story than meets the eye, and (4) it is necessary to get to the level of personal significance when interpreting problematic forms of behavior. It is argued that the 4 assumptions function as ""demand characteristics"" in that they structure the therapist's mode of intention, and that these demand characteristics play a role in bringing about a self-reflexive stance on the part of the patient. The use of the discourse marker ""I don't know"" in transcripts of psychotherapy with a female patient with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder is then examined in terms of the context-driven agenda of having the patient self-inspect and self-reflect.

"176","Acquaintance rape awareness program: Effects on attitudes and perceptions","The present study investigates the effects of an acquaintance rape awareness program on college students' attitudes and perceptions. The current study is unique in that it combines pre- and post-testing of standardized measures of attitudes with an awareness program specific to acquaintance rape and an adequate control group receiving information about sexually transmitted diseases. More than one scenario is employed to evaluate the subjects' ability to accurately define the occurrence of rape across a range of situations. Subjects were led to believe they were participating in two separate experiments in order to decrease demand characteristics. During the pre- and post-tests, subjects rated three scenarios and completed questionnaires. For the education phase, subjects were randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups. Results indicate that the acquaintance rape awareness program affects college students' attitudes and perceptions. The treatment group is more empathic toward the victim than is the control group. Furthermore, treatment group males are more egalitarian in their attitudes toward women than are control group males. Within the treatment group, males change more in their attitudes toward women post-intervention than do females. However, given that females score higher than males on the AWS in this study, females have less room for change. More importantly, males change their attitudes in a positive manner after receiving the treatment intervention. Not only are attitudes changed in a positive manner, but treatment group subjects are more certain of their definitions of rape situations post-education. An important finding is that treatment group males are better able to define a situation as rape post-intervention than are control group males. Furthermore, as scenario subtlety increases, males are less able to accurately define a rape situation than are females. Therefore, females are generally more certain of their definitions than are males (PsycInfo (2022) Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","0","5","N/A","N/A",NA,"Pinzone, Holly Ann","1995","https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/acquaintance-rape-awareness-program-effects-on/docview/618740338/se-2?accountid=14026","APA PsycInfo (2022)"

S. Luchins's (1942) 6 water jug problems, in which 3 problems required an elaborate formula (EF) and 3 allowed simpler solutions. Ss were assigned alternatively to rule (experimental) or nonrule (control) condition, and Ss in the experimental condition were informed that all problems could be solved using the same EF. Experimental Ss solved problems quickly but failed to use more efficient solutions. Instructions led to more reported compliance with perceived demand characteristics, continued use of the more EF for the sake of speed and convenience, and the expectation that fewer problems allowed alternative solutions. Results suggest that sensitivity to contingencies and the Einstelling effect appear to be homologous phenomena and may share common behavioral processes.

The testing procedures reliably produced changes in autonomic output in the expected directions, but Ss with PD were not found to differ from controls in their cardiorespiratory or plasma catecholaminergic responses. This pattern of normal AR in PD Ss was evident across test conditions with varying autonomic demand characteristics, thereby supporting the integrity of autonomic regulatory systems in this illness.

Articulation performance was retarded by induction of depression and was accelerated by induction of elation. Changes in speech rates also correlated with conventional self-report measures of affective state. The MXP task appeared more sensitive to the mood manipulation than did the self-paced task. Results support the view that laboratory-based MI procedures promote affective change and indicate that the speeded articulation task constitutes an effective indicator of that change.

DCs are defined as experimental cues that influence Ss to respond in ways that validate the experimental hypothesis. In Exp 1, DCs were controlled in 1 group by having 10 male undergraduates rate each pain component in a separate session 1 wk apart, so as to minimize recall. This group failed to differentiate between SP and AP; however, another group of 10 male undergraduates with DCs left uncontrolled provided disparate and parallel functions for the 2 pain components. This indicates that recall during concurrent ratings of SP and AP contributes to a spurious separation of ratings for each component. Exp 2 controlled DCs, and employed a medication placebo with 10 of the Ss from Exp 1. Ratings of AP were significantly lower than those for SP.

"190","Hypnosis and sport psychology","Hypnosis has been used in the field of sport psychology for a number of years as a research tool in efforts designed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying physical performance. Also, there have been numerous clinical applications designed to enhance performance in sport settings, and these interventions have been based largely on theoretical formulations as opposed to empirical research evidence. These clinical applications have generally been successful, but there has been little attention paid to behavioral artifacts such as expectancy effects, placebo effects, and demand characteristics in this work. Furthermore, there is no evidence that effects obtained with these clinical applications exceed those that one might achieve with the same or comparable approaches in the absence of hypnosis. Efforts to enhance athletic performance by increasing or decreasing precompetitive anxiety have usually not been effective. This can be explained by the observation that most athletes perform best within a narrow ZOA (zone of optimal anxiety). An area in which hypnosis has proven to be effective in sport psychology involves the interpretation of decreased performance levels (i.e., slumps and failure) in previously successful individuals.

Posttraining hypnotizability scores for Ss given honesty instructions were consistently smaller than those for 15 Ss who did not receive these instructions, implying that scores for the latter group exaggerate the extent to which hypnotic experiences are altered by the CST program. The pattern of results supports the view that demand characteristics contribute to the efficacy of the CST program and that improvements in actual hypnotic talent are more limited than has been thought.

"199","A critical appraisal of demand artifacts in consumer research","Distinguishes between the terms ""demand artifacts"" (DAs) and ""demand characteristics"" and explores why the issue of DAs is troubling to researchers. The necessary conditions for DAs are that the S must (1) encode a demand cue that would alert him/her to the research hypothesis, (2) discern the correct hypothesis or guess another hypothesis that is incidentally correlated with the true hypothesis, and (3) act on the hypothesis by conforming to a certain role that leads to biased responses on dependent-variable measures. Three suppositions extending from the view that DAs are prevalent in consumer research are appraised: (1) Failure to replicate prior findings may indicate DAs are responsible for the initial findings, (2) DAs create false-positive readings, and (3) DAs can be controlled by postexperimental inquiries and deleting hypothesis guessers.

Interactions varied in their prearranged demand characteristics to which the VIAS proved sensitive. In Exp 2, 19 Ss participated in initial interactions with a confederate. Confederates were covertly instructed either to talk predominantly about themselves, or to ask questions about the Ss. The resulting interactions produced significantly different outcomes for the 2 conditions when measured with the VIAS.

Experiment 3 showed that the color-induced increase in odor intensity is not due to subjects' preexperimental experience with particular color–odor combinations, because the increase occurred with novel ones. We conclude that color induces a weak olfactory percept that combines with odorant-induced percepts.

In Exp 1, the motivation for participation was payment rather than course credit; in Exp 2, 1 task imposed a continuous load on Ss. In Exp 1, no trade-off was observed, and Ss did not respond to the requirements, possibly because when Ss are highly motivated to perform well, they do not conform to demand characteristics. In Exp 2, performance trade-off was not observed. However, Ss tried to adjust their performance to the requirements. The lack of trade-off is attributed to the absence of a real limit on performance.

The studies reviewed were limited to those that include ""hard"" data: validated self-reports, seroprevalence outcomes, or self-reports of behavior that is opposed to any of the demand characteristics generated by the research setting. For two groups of current IV drug users—those entering drug treatment and those continuing to inject—these hard data studies show rapidly induced AIDS risk reduction but suggest a need for large-scale change maintained over long time periods. In terms of preventing initial injection, alternative forms of intense drug use have emerged but have not supplanted drug injection, and basic knowledge of AIDS does not appear to deter initial drug injection.

Two S groups were exposed to REST. Situational demand characteristics (SDCs) outlined by M. T. Orne (1962) favored an increase in hypnotizability for REST Group 1 (high demand [HD]). REST Group 2 (low demand [LD]) was exposed to SDCs designed to disguise the experimental hypothesis. Two control groups were exposed to the same alternative SDC manipulations. The Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale, Form C (SHSS:C) was administered before and after treatment.

"228","Specific retroactive interference in modified recognition tests: Evidence for an unknown cause of interference","McCloskey and Zaragoza (1985a) have recently argued that all item-specific retroactive interference (RI) can be attributed to response bias or demand characteristics. These sources of RI were eliminated in the present studies by a modified recognition test that excluded the interpolated item. Nature pictures were shown; some were followed by related pictures (experimental), and others were followed by dissimilar pictures (control). When forced to choose between two related pictures (the original and a new picture), the original picture was chosen more often for control than for experimental items (Experiments 1 and 2). Paired-associate studies were cited that have found RI in analogous matching recognition tests. These findings contradict McCloskey and Zaragoza's conclusion and must be attributed to some other cause of item-specific RI, such as trace alteration (e.g., Loftus, 1979). Experiments 3 and 4 showed that most items must be accessible in order to detect RI in the forced-choice modified test. However, even with sensitive measures, RI has not always been found in modified recognition. Suggestions are offered to explain the discrepant results.

"235","Musical imagery: Generation of tones and chords","Four experiments are reported that examine Ss' ability to form and use images of tones and chords. In Exps 1 and 3, Ss heard a cue tone or chord and formed an image of a tone or chord one whole step in pitch above the cue. This image was then compared to a probe tone or chord that was either the same as the image in pitch, different from the image in pitch and harmonically closely related, or different and harmonically distantly related. In Exp 3, a random-tone mask was used to control for possible contributions of the cue in echoic memory. In both experiments tone images were formed faster than chord images, a result consistent with the idea of structural complexity as a determinant of image formation time. Response times and accuracy rates were found to parallel results found in music perception studies, results consistent with the idea of shared mechanisms in the processing of musical images and percepts. Exps 2 and 4 were control experiments examining the possible influence of demand characteristics and Ss' knowledge. Findings rule out the possibility that demand characteristics and Ss' knowledge were solely responsible for the results of Exps 1 and 3 and support the role of imagery.

Malamuth and Edward Donnerstein (1984). The present author contends that this collection (and the work it reports) has recently figured importantly in discussions of censorship, and closer scrutiny would seem to be in order. First, the linking of aggression to the stimulus film following exposure to aggressive pornography is ambiguous since the aggression is almost always produced following both personal provocation and erotic stimulation. Second, there are fundamentally different explanations of the results. Third, the levels of aggression obtained in these lab studies are remarkably modest proxies for actual rape and assault. Fourth, evidence of changes in attitudes reported by Zillmann and Bryant following massive exposure to pornography is highly contentious. Fifth, most of the results reported may be confounded with, if not completely attributable to, demand characteristics of the experiments employed. The principals in this volume form a small group of experimentalists who constitute a not so invisible college and who, sharing similar value positions, cite the work of one another uncritically.

Orne, the 1986 recipient of the Distinguished Scientific Award for the Applications of Psychology, was presented with a check for $2,000 and an engrossed citation of his contribution. Orne receives this award ""for his efforts to integrate psychological theory and methods with the pragmatic concerns of psychotherapy, medicine, and law. Through his research he has helped practitioners to realize the potential benefits and limitations of hypnosis, lie detection, sleep, and biofeedback, and the roles played by specific and nonspecific factors in psychotherapy and behavioral medicine. His analysis of the social context of the experiment has elucidated the importance of demand characteristics in shaping experience and behavior, and helped alter the way in which both experimentalists and clinicians evaluate the reactions of subjects, clients, and patients. Psychologist, physician, scientist, clinician, editor, and expert witness, no one better exemplifies the theoretical and practical advantages of transcending disciplinary boundaries in the pursuit of our common goals.""

"254","The suggestibility of children in interview studies","Two factors related to the suggestibility of children are examined: (1) the emphasis placed on giving a classifiable answer to every question and (2) the effects of repeated questioning within an interview. 72 children (aged 6, 8, and 10 yrs) were questioned about a staged event they had witnessed earlier. It was found that telling Ss that they could say ""Don't know"" to questions increased the number of such responses, but with no effect on the proportion of correct/incorrect responses. Ss who had not been instructed in the use of this response were also prepared to say ""Don't know."" Repeated questioning resulted in a decrease in the number of correct responses given.

"255","Generalised anxiety: A controlled treatment study","Evaluated the effectiveness of anxiety management (AM) training by allocating 66 generally anxious clients (aged 18–65 yrs) to a wait-list condition, nondirective counseling, or a combination of relaxation and brief cognitive therapy. AM was significantly more effective than the wait-list condition in reducing clinical anxiety, but there were few differences between AM and nondirective counseling at posttreatment or 6-mo follow-up. Differences that were found were explained in terms of the demand characteristics of training in relaxation or cognitive therapy. It is concluded that AM is better than a nontreatment control condition, but that its superiority to alternatives lacking the components thought to be responsible for improvement has yet to be demonstrated.

Using 46 Israeli male Ss (average age 18 yrs), the effects of experimenter's (E's) position and stimulus location were studied by a technique for inferring locus of perception. E's position, rather than stimulus location, affected Ss' locus of perception. It is concluded that perception of stimuli on the body involves 3 independent factors: (a) the demand characteristics of the experiment, (b) the manner in which an individual perceives the boundaries of his/her own body, and (c) an individual's ability to adopt the E's perceptual standpoint.

There is little evidence supporting many of these assumptions, one of which is that experimental Ss disbelieve the cover story given them. It is argued that a demonstration that Ss participating in the Velten mood induction procedure can accurately mimic the reactions of participants given the Velten statements when they are explicitly asked to do so, or when they are instructed how to simulate these reactions, does not necessarily mean that Ss will voluntarily engage in such accurate play-acting when they are not asked to engage in this make-believe. Research has also noted that a number of Velten-induced reactions are probably too subtle to have been deliberately faked.

"259","Demand characteristics and the response suppression hypothesis","31 undergraduates were given the opportunity to pull a plunger (Linsley manipulandum) or press a small panel in a 3-stage design. Five minutes of free access (baseline) was followed by a 5-min contingency phase in which 10 responses to the plunger were required to free the panel for a single press. This was followed by a 5-min return to baseline. From a postexperiment questionnaire, Ss were judged to have been either aware or unaware of the contingent relation between the plunger and the panel. Those judged to have been aware yielded much higher rates of plunger pulling during the contingent phase and were more active during baseline measurement. These results raise problems for the response suppression methodology of R. Eisenberger et al (see record 1967-11372-001), since they can be as readily accounted for by M. T.

Under both regressed and simulating conditions, adult task scores were substantially higher than those of the children, though slightly lower than scores obtained during the normal adult state. The modest partial regression obtained suggests superficial performance adjustments attributable to procedure demand characteristics or to enhancement of role playing rather than temporary modifications of cognitive structure.

Men viewing the pink or orange panels had higher grip strength under pink-strengthen than under pink-weaken instruction. For women, the pink-weaken instructions resulted in a higher grip strength than did the pink-strengthen instructions, regardless of actual color present. In Exp I, with 27 female and 27 male undergraduates, women in a no-instruction control condition had lower grip strength than women given the pink-weaken instructions. For men, the no-instruction control condition resulted in higher grip strength than the pink-weaken condition.

The time course of changes in the dependent variables was monitored, and expectancy biases and demand characteristics were minimized. Lactate increased self-reported anxiety and heart rate equally in Ss and controls. The only variables showing statistically different responses between the groups were systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Overall, in both groups, the effects of lactate were similar to states of natural panic or anxiety for both self-report measures and heart rate.

In the present study, 40 speech-anxious 18–32 yr olds were assessed for physiological arousal, self-report of anxiety, and behavioral avoidance within the context of a behavioral avoidance test requiring the presentation of an unprepared speech before a live audience. Measures included the Fear Survey Schedule and the State scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. These data were used to test R. Hodgson and S. Rachman's (1974) hypothesis that response concordance varies as a function of the level of demand present during the assessment. Results indicate that high demand produced response discordance. However, low demand did not result in the response concordance hypothesized to occur under this condition. Findings are discussed in terms of the effects of level of demand on response indices of anxiety and the utility of the tripartite assessment method.

Problems in the social-emotional assessment of preschool children are discussed, including their inability to read, the restrictions on their verbal and visual-motor response capabilities, their lack of complex information-processing skills necessary for certain types of questions, and their relative inability to understand the demand characteristics of the assessment situation and to control their behavior to meet these demands. Methods of social-emotional assessment include interviewing, direct observation, rating scales, sociometry, and associative techniques. Assessment designs are considered, and it is suggested that a good assessment design involves the application of assessment procedures in such a way that the characteristics of the child that are most pertinent are assessed, the effects of the environment are taken into account, and the errors of measurement are minimized.

"271","Experimental construct validity in the evaluation of cognitive and behavioral treatments for depression","Distilled versions of A. T. Beck's (1967, 1976) cognitive and P. M. Lewinsohn's (1974) behavioral treatments for depression were crossed in a 2 × 2 design that included combined and high-demand treatments. Ss were 40 clients seeking services at a university counseling center. Measures included the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, an automatic thoughts questionnaire, and social skills ratings. Data reveal that the Cognitive Treatment factor produced a consistent and durable impact on instruments reflecting cognitive manifestations of depression; some generalization to the behavioral domain occurred as well. The Behavioral Treatment factor failed to produce improvement within the corresponding behavioral assessment battery or on any cognitive device. Analysis of BDI data suggested possible evidence favoring each factor. Both conditions generated equivalent demand characteristics and counselor ratings of client adherence to treatment. No interactions involving the treatments occurred. The obtained pattern of convergent and divergent outcomes indicates considerable construct-valid strength for cognitive therapy applied to a moderately depressed population. Possible reasons for behavior therapy's comparatively weak showing are discussed.

Valins (see record 1966-12940-001) and reviews subsequent research using the false autonomic feedback procedure that offers evidence concerning the validity of Valins's analysis. Alternative interpretations of these findings are considered that involve artefacts related to demand characteristics and inappropriate control procedures or cognitive and physiological mediation. Potential limitations to the generality of the false-feedback effect are discussed in terms of target strength and type. It is argued that feedback changes are perceived as credible in conjunction with only a limited range of emotional stimuli and that reactions to stimuli outside this range cannot be modified by provision or arousal information. It is concluded that Valins's model of affective processes has only restricted application to real-life emotional phenomena.

"274","Theories relating mental imagery to perception","Reviews contemporary theories of relations between mental imagery and perception in terms of structural, functional, and interactive theories. Structural theories propose that mental images exhibit the same spatial and pictorial properties as real physical objects. Functional theories propose that the formation and transformation of mental images contribute to object recognition and comparison. Interactive theories propose that imagery contributes directly to ongoing perceptual processes. The evidence for each type of theory is critically evaluated in view of the following alternative accounts: task-induced demand characteristics, experimenter bias, tacit knowledge, and eye movements. Efforts to rule out these alternatives have had varying degrees of success, with the consequence that the 3 types of imagery theories differ in the extent to which they have been confirmed (i.e., none of the 3 types of imagery theories is universally free from challenges from at least some of the alternative accounts).

"275","Is time to scan visual images due to demand characteristics?","Examined whether the finding that the time to scan across an object in a mental image increases with the distance scanned reflects the operation of underlying mechanisms or the effects of demand characteristics. Two types of demand characteristics were considered in 4 experiments with 146 undergraduates. First, the scanning effects were shown to persist even when they conflicted with the experimenters' expectations. Experimenters were led to expect different rates of scanning and different effects of distance on scan times, but the results in all cases showed no experimenter effects, instead displaying the usual increase in time with distance scanned. Second, the scanning effects were shown to persist in the absence of implicit task demands. Effects of distance were observed in an experiment in which Ss were never asked to scan the image; such effects were observed only for items that should require spontaneous scanning even though they were randomly intermixed with items that should not, and this distinction was never mentioned nor alluded to in the instructions. Thus, experimenter effects and task demands are not sufficient explanations for the increase in the time to scan across an image as distance is increased.

"276","Demand characteristics in image scanning experiments","Reviews image-scanning experiments to support the claim that scanning time increases linearly with distance rather than in response to demand characteristics. Some counterinterpretations (e.g., the 2nd author; see record 1981-06699-001) point to experimenter expectancy effects and task demand effects. In M. J. Intons-Peterson's (see record 1984-02983-001) experiment, experimenter expectancy affected the intercept of the scanning function but not the scanning rate. In a previous study, the present authors (in press) timed Ss' scanning between locations on an imaged map. Experimenters were led to expect a variety of results. Experimenter expectancy did not affect the shape of the scanning function. In another study designed to test task demands effects, the present authors (1980) performed a scanning experiment in which neither the word scan nor any synonym was mentioned in the instructions. Results indicate that the scanning effect obtained could not have been due to task demands. Overall findings suggest that the scanning effect is not a consequence of demand characteristics; rather, individuals can scan mental images and it is the spatial properties of the image representation that cause scanning times to depend on the distance scanned.

Ss were administered a stress incident record (SIR) on which they were asked to describe a concrete event that had occurred over the past 2 wks that had been stressful to them. The SIR had 2 forms: The 1st, which was sent to 25% of the Ss selected randomly, asked Ss to describe a stressful incident in their lives generally; the 2nd, which was sent to the remaining 75%, specifically instructed that the event described should be work related. The study differed from conventional approaches to the study of stress in that it focused on acute stressful incidents rather than on Ss' generalizations about typical circumstances at work. It also focused on a single occupational group, and Ss were openly invited to indicate that nothing stressful had occurred so that the amount of stress would not be overestimated as a result of demand characteristics. About 40% of the Ss reported a stressful event at work in the previous 2 wks. When given a choice between stress at work or outside of work, Ss were twice as likely to report the former. Considerable emphasis was placed on the ineffective and wasteful use of time as a source of stress. The most frequently cited emotional experiences were anger, annoyance, and frustration.

"279","Syntactical learning and judgment, still unconscious and still abstract: Comment on Dulany, Carlson, and Dewey","Reviews the evidence presented by D. E. Dulany et al (see record 1985-29949-001) in support of their conclusion that implicit learning of artificial grammars is really explicit learning. It is argued that the constraints of the task by Dulany et al to assess Ss' knowledge base carries demand characteristics that may make implicit knowledge appear to be explicitly represented. Related issues, such as the nature of conscious and unconscious control of action, the degree of abstractness of tacit knowledge, the existence of formal vs informal (correlated) grammars, and the nature of intuition, are discussed. A functionalist position in all matters is advocated.

"280","Hoffmann reflex variations produced by task demand characteristics","The amplitude of the Hoffmann reflex (H reflex) and heart rate were studied during the performance by 13 23–27 yr old students of 2 versions of a mental task and a tracking task varying in degree of difficulty. Modification of the H reflex did not depend on the nature of the task. A slight increase in cardiac rhythm and a facilitation of H reflex during easy tasks and a marked increase in cardic rhythm associated with inhibition of H reflex during difficult tasks were observed. It is suggested that the increase in H reflex is due to an activation of the reticular formation. The inhibition of motor response is attributed to an effortful process that develops when the tasks become difficult.

Research suggests that anorexics overestimate their body size.

Results indicate that both spontaneous amnesia after hypnosis and spontaneous recovery during rehypnosis are associated with repression but not with hypnotic suggestibility. In contrast, both suggested forgetting and suggested recovery are associated with hypnotic suggestibility but not with repression. Whereas the latter effects of suggestibility are attributable to the demand characteristics of hypnotic suggestions, the spontaneous effects of hypnosis on repressors' memories are not reducible to social psychological principles.

"283","A conceptualization of hypnosis: II. Hypnotic induction procedures and manifestations of the hypnotic state","Extends an earlier discussion by the authors (see record 1983-09698-001) by centering on hypnotic induction procedures and manifestations of the hypnotic state. The discussion of hypnotic induction presents a logic of inductions, with application to preliminary procedures (e.g., redescription techniques) and to 3 formal methods of induction: absorption, relaxation, and confusion. The discussion of manifestations of the hypnotic state includes focused attention, suggested effects, nonsuggested effects, and the consequences of specific induction procedures or demand characteristics. It is concluded that the conceptualization of hypnosis and related phenomena in terms of final-order appraisals and anomaly integrates the field and provides answers to puzzling issues.

"285","The cognitive model of depression and mood-induction procedures: A reply to Clark (1983)","In an article on mood-induction procedures, D. M. Clark (1983) concluded that (1) E. Velten's (1968) mood induction procedure (VMIP) produces a good analog state of mild, naturally occurring, retarded depression that is not explicable in terms of experimental demand characteristics and (2) it is erroneous to view the relative success of the VMIP in simulating the effects of depression as support for cognitive theories of depression. While the present authors agree with the 1st of Clark's conclusions, they disagree with his 2nd conclusion; Clark's ideas regarding the impact of the VMIP on mood and behavior are not supported by the existing data. Therefore, the VMIP results can be used to support A. T. Beck's (1976) cognitive theory of depression.

"286","Perceived position and saccadic eye movements","In an experiment with 16 observers with normal vision, a delay between the presentation of an apparently stepped target point and the signal to saccade was introduced: It was hypothesized that if these delayed saccades bring the eye to the target's perceived position, whereas immediate saccades are directed toward its actual position, the difference could not be attributed to the task's demand characteristics; results would suggest that the representation of retinotopic stimulus position is of short duration or insufficient strength to supersede the perceptual representation of position in the delay condition. Findings support the conclusion that saccades that occur 600 msec or more after the brief presentation of a target stimulus are directed to its perceived position when that differs from both its retinal and spatial position. The finding that saccades to remembered positions are influenced by perception is consistent with data on the relation between perception and pursuit eye movements. Implications for understanding oculomotor control and schema theories of perception are discussed. That perception plays a minimal role in eye movement programming creates a problem for understanding the relation between perceiving and eye movements.

In a harsh critique of traditional research on social and physical problems of the widowed, Hyman proposes the secondary analysis of nationwide sample surveys as a ""new path to knowledge."" This approach avoids three pitfalls of the small sample interview studies on which he focuses much of his attack. First, it avoids demand characteristics. No connection between widowhood and the variables measured is made during data collection. Second, sampling bias through self-selection, one of the most critical problems in in-depth interviewing of bereaved samples, is circumvented. Third, the data are from representative samples and thus permit more generalization than do small-sample studies.

Results show that Ss who received a persuasive communication were more agreeable toward the issue than those who received no communication. Ss who were highly involved and tested under a bogus pipeline showed minimal change. An analysis of change scores between attitudes pre- and postmanipulation yielded the same conclusions.

Pinker (see PA, Vols 68:5010 and 71:5803) showed Ss an array of dots followed by an arrow in a blank field and asked them to determine whether the arrow pointed to any of the previously seen dots. Response times were linearly related to the distance between the arrow and the nearest dot, suggesting that Ss spontaneously used an internal scanning or extrapolation process to perform the task. The present 3 experiments with 116 undergraduates replicated and extended this finding by varying the retention interval and by employing a paradigm in which Ss' eyes were closed and the arrows were described to them using a coordinate scheme. Ss were unable to predict the form of the data when the task simply was described to them. Results suggest that mental scanning along a straight path can be performed on images reconstructed from memory and that it does not depend on the ongoing perception of a continuous surface, physical eye movements, or on demand characteristics.

There was no clear pattern of internal consistency among responses to the 7 information opportunities, and performance on the CIR did not predict self-report measures of career information-seeking behavior. CIR scores also failed to correlate with self-observations of actual information-seeking events.

"293","Understanding strategic interactions in television commercials: A developmental study","Introduces a cognitive–developmental assessment procedure to explain age-related differences in the comprehension of TV advertising messages. The procedure involves the sociological concepts of strategic interaction (SI) and recursive thinking (RCT), the social analog of B. Inhelder et al (1974), and the Piagetian analysis of formal operational reasoning. 84 kindergartners, 3rd and 6th graders, and undergraduates viewed 4 TV commercials for children's food products containing SIs between 2 siblings. Ss were assessed for their understanding of the actors' behaviors and thoughts and for their understanding of the intent and persuasive strategy of the advertiser. Results indicate effects for both age level and commercial structure. Results indicate major increments between kindergarten and 3rd grade for 1-loop RCT, which was a function of the demand characteristics of the question. Two-loop RCT was characteristic of a small proportion of 6th graders but was typical of undergraduates. Consistent with previous research, findings indicate that the development of 2-loop RCT is a decidedly protracted affair that continues well into adolescence. Implications for policy affecting children and TV advertising are discussed. (50 ref) (PsycInfo (2022) Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)","0","2","N/A","N/A",NA,"Paget, K.

"294","Predispositions about learning from print and television","Two experiments with 151 6th graders studied the implications of previous studies showing that the way children treat TV strongly depends on their preconceptions rather than on any necessary limitation imposed by the medium on the processing of material. Previous studies also found that children's preconceptions of TV do not prescribe the mobilization of their related abilities, whereas their preconceptions of printed material do. The construct of self-reported amount of invested mental effort (AIME) was used to measure depth of processing and was defined as the number of nonautomatic mental elaborations applied to a unit of material. In Exp I, Ss reported that printed materials commanded more mental effort than TV. Ss' general preconceptions of the mental demands required by TV and print were reflected in the amounts of effort they reported expending when they encountered a specific TV story or its comparable version in print. Exp II indicated that Ss' way of treating TV (their AIME and inference making) were penetrable through the demand characteristics of TV that they were experimentally made to perceive. It is concluded that there is an ongoing reciprocal interplay between children's preconceptions and expectations and the TV fare they encounter.

"295","Rehabilitative neuropsychological approach for severe traumatic brain-injured patients","Points out that individuals who sustain severe traumatic brain injury frequently suffer diminished, lost, or altered intellectual cognitive, social, and emotional functioning that is long lasting. Unfortunately, a significant number of psychologists who see these patients may only view their role as diagnostic rather than rehabilitative and may adhere to a philosophy of ""therapeutic nihilism."" This attitude appears in part to be based on the long-held assumption that brain damage is permanent and irreversible, on the widespread use of neuropsychological tests that place little emphasis on rehabilitation, on the failure in the past of clinical training programs in psychology to offer training in the rehabilitation of the brain-injured patient, and on the invidious dichotomy frequently made between psychological and organic causes of behavior. A neuropsychological rehabilitative model for the assessment, treatment, and rehabilitation of the brain-injured patient within a private practice setting is presented that emphasizes the quality of the interaction between the patient's strengths and deficits and the demand characteristics of the environment.

"296","Component analysis of occupational stress inoculation applied to registered nurses in an acute care hospital setting","The stress inoculation (SI) paradigm, which consists of education (ED), coping skills training (CST), and exposure to simulated stressors (EX), was applied to the occupational stress experienced by nurses. Occupational stress was operationally defined in terms of 13 dependent measures reflecting problem areas summarized by the acronym ReACT (retrograde complaints, assertiveness deficits, competency concerns, and time stress). ReACT also stood for the ingredients of the CST component (relaxation training, assertive skill building, cognitive restructuring, and time management instruction). To determine which SI components produce a treatment effect, 60 White female acute-care registered nurses (mean age 33.8 yrs) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 active treatment cells: SI, CST, EX, ED, or no treatment (NT). Ss were administered a battery of tests that included the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory and Rathus Assertiveness Schedule. A MANOVA at posttest, and subsequent univariate analyses simultaneously considering 4-mo follow-up data, demonstrated that SI is an effective treatment with durable benefits and that CST is its principal ingredient. Additional demand-characteristics analyses indicated that these effects are not due to placebo-related phenomena.

"299","Effect of cognitive effort on learning disabled and nondisabled readers' recall","Learning-disabled (LD) and non-LD (NLD) readers can be distinguished by the extent to which their free recall of words is affected by the attention demand characteristics (cognitive effort) of items. An intentional auditory free recall task was presented after LD and NLD solved anagrams from semantic, phonemic, and unrelated word lists. The anagrams varied in terms of low and high cognitive effort (defined as the reorganization task demand on a limited memory capacity). Exp I, with 10 LD and 10 NLD Ss (mean age 9 yrs), showed that high effort led to better recall than low effort for NLD Ss, while LD Ss were superior to NLD Ss in the recall of low-effort words. Exp II, with 2 groups of 12 LD and NLD Ss (mean ages 8 and 10 yrs respectively), replicated this finding across developmental age and type of word lists. Exp III, with 9 LD Ss (mean age 9 yrs), indicated that Ss were less likely to recall words of high cognitive effort as compared with intermediate and low ones. Findings support the hypothesis that nondisabled and disabled readers differ in processing capacity and suggest that cognitive effort may be a relevant factor in word-encoding processes.

In general, sociometric nominations were accurate in predicting who was not behaviorally helpful—those Ss rated as the unpopular and unhelpful. Sociometric status of Ss rated more positively by peers did not predict well the level of behavioral performance. To examine the interaction between peer-group status and helping behavior, the most helpful Ss were divided into 2 groups on the basis of peer status. There were significant differences in the types of situations in which these 2 groups performed: More popular helpers scored higher on peer-related helping tasks, whereas less popular helpers were more facilitative in non-peer-related helping tasks. Implications for individual socialization and future research in helping behavior are discussed in relation to peer-group status.

"303","The effect of an experimentally induced demand on nocturnal dream content","Tested the hypothesis that demand characteristics may influence dream content. Laboratory and home dreams were collected from 12 undergraduates allocated to 2 matched groups. The independent variable, a simple form, was administered to each group, and Ss were requested to pay special attention to either the outdoor/nature or urban settings of their nocturnal dreams. Ss did not consciously construe these forms as representing an attempt to influence their dreams. Nevertheless, in the treatment condition, the dream settings of both groups changed significantly in the predicted direction as assessed by 2 quantitative indices. Results suggest that demand characteristics implicit in the experimental situation exert a significant effect on the reported manifest dream content. Findings imply that the failure to control for demand characteristics in empirical investigations of dream content renders interpretation of the findings suspect, and there are theoretical implications for psychotherapeutic strategies employing differing methods of dream analysis and interpretation.

"304","The use of hypnosis to enhance recall","54 Ss, selected on the basis of high or low scores on the Stanford Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility, were presented with 60 drawings of common objects and tested for immediate recall. Ss then attempted to recall the items on each of the next 6 days and were then retested with or without hypnosis. Hypnotically susceptible Ss in the hypnosis condition recalled significantly more new items but made almost 3 times as many errors as Ss in any other condition. These results were replicated with a 2nd sample of 56 Ss. Possible explanations of the increase in items recalled under hypnosis include (1) a lower degree of caution in what Ss were willing to report as memories, which could be attributed to demand characteristics, social cues, and expectations regarding the hypnotic situation, and (2) hypnotic enhancement of mental imagery that led to a false sense of recognition. Results argue against the forensic use of hypnosis.

"305","Assertions regarding effectiveness of treatment for alcoholism: Fact or fantasy?","Treatment of alcoholism and public policy decisions are likely to be misguided when based on the uncritical adoption of treatment-effectiveness claims. Thoughtful consideration of any assertion of effectiveness of treatment of alcoholism rests on an understanding of external and internal validity issues as well as the issue of comprehensiveness of evaluation. Treatment-outcome figures are influenced by such external validity factors as patient characteristics, sample selection and attrition, patient experiences outside of and after treatment, time of evaluation in relation to treatment, type and definition of criterion variables, measurement of criterion variables, and the analysis and interpretation of data. Among the internal validity factors affecting outcome rates are investigator bias, demand characteristics, and efforts to compare patient self-report data with other sources of information. A comprehensive assessment of treatment effectiveness requires the use of multiple-outcome criterion measures such as treatment completion, recidivism, physical health, and social and emotional functioning as well as evaluation of drinking behavior.

"306","Mechanisms of hypnotic and nonhypnotic forgetting","40 undergraduates participated in 2 experimental sessions designed to study laboratory-induced amnesia, one using a standard hypnosis paradigm and one using a nonhypnotic directed-forgetting paradigm. Two independent sources of variation were derived from the hypnotic amnesia data: retrieval inhibition and inhibition release. In the nonhypnotic directed-forgetting procedure, some items were cued to be either forgotten or remembered. At test, over 39% of the variance in the recall of the to-be-forgotten items could be accounted for by the inhibition and release constructs obtained with hypnosis. These relations between the 2 procedures were not mediated by verbal ability (WAIS) or cognitive style (Hidden Figures Test). It is concluded that the mechanisms of forgetting involved in laboratory demonstrations of hypnotic and nonhypnotic amnesia are related, and the implication is that some of them are the same, namely, retrieval inhibition and inhibition release. Possible demand characteristics that accompany the hypnosis procedure were not apparent with the nonhypnotic procedure. Results provide evidence that hypnotically induced amnesia is not entirely the result of Ss' reactions to demand characteristics.

SMT in turn was compared to a no-treatment control condition (NT). Simulated job interviews were conducted 3 wks after treatment with 55 undergraduates who had been assigned to 1 of 4 treatments or NT. The Job Interview Rating Scale, knowledge scores, and speaking time were included in the measures of interviewing proficiency. Significant gains were attributable to CM on 4 of 6 social skills criteria. The SC and combination (CM plus SC) treatments produced significant improvement on all dependent variables. Evidence favoring SMT over NT was weak. Cost–benefit implications for the theoretically derived CM and SC treatments are discussed.

On the validity of self-report measures of alcohol dependence and related constructs","67 male and 47 female alcoholics (mean ages 39 and 37 yrs, respectively) completed a self-report battery assessing information pertaining to biological function, psychiatric history, psychological status, social adjustment, and drinking history. Factor analysis was used to derive composite measures of alcohol dependence, withdrawal symptomatology, pathological intoxication, and alcoholic psychosis. Validation was conducted by comparing these measures with independent and external criteria—drinking estimates made by collateral informants, measures of general alcohol involvement, and drinking behavior 6 mo after treatment. Results support each type of validity (concurrent, discriminant, construct, and predictive), and thereby contradict the assumption that alcoholics' self-reports are not accurate. The question of unreliable self-report data due to the demand characteristics under which the information is obtained is addressed.

"310","Four factors affecting perceived aggressiveness","In Exp I, with 30 25–45 yr old hospital employees, a distinction was made between cause (intent) and reason, and predictions about their respective effects on perceived aggressiveness were assessed. Both factors influenced Ss' perceptions. Exp II, with 67 undergraduates, showed that the effects of 6 modes of harming varied under different conditions of intent and reason. In Exp III (96 19–62 yr old doctors, nurses, and nurses' assistants), 4 factors—intent, reason, mode of harm, and severity of harm—influenced Ss' perceptions of aggressiveness. Different experimental designs were used to control for demand characteristics, and hospital employees were used to control for sophistication that might be associated with behavioral science students. A phenomenon common for all 3 experiments (i.e., most Ss who had attributed no intent to harm to the actor nevertheless rated him as displaying aggressiveness) is discussed with reference to the factors of mode and severity in harm.

Cartoon characters, including Wonder Woman and Superman, were used to encourage Ss in self-recording, cleaning up, theme participation, and group-time behavior. The results demonstrate that high-interest cartoon models were both effective and feasible agents for positive behavioral change when used within the generalized imitation framework. In addition, 4 alternative explanations of generalized imitation were tested: the failure to discriminate explanation, the variable-ratio schedule explanation, the demand characteristics explanation, and the reinforcement value of stimulus similarity explanation.

"312","The enhancement of memory by hypnosis in the legal investigative situation","The increasing use of hypnosis on North America to enhance or refresh the memories of victims and witnesses of crime is creating concern, both within the professional hypnosis societies and within the legal profession. The authors review current positions on the issue and survey clinical and experimental data bearing on the efficacy of hypnosis as a means of memory enhancement. The 2 main problems associated with the use of hypnosis in the legal investigative context—confabulation and the creation of pseudo-memories—are discussed, with particular reference to the demand characteristics of the investigative context. Some recent court cases where confabulation was demonstrated unequivocally and several recent American state supreme court rulings are presented. The need for stringent safeguards proposed by M. T. Orne (1978) is discussed, and the relevance of the American experience of the past 15 yrs to the Canadian context is emphasized.

"313","Dissociation, duality, and demand characteristics in hypnosis","Examined hypnotic dissociation (as indexed by the ""hidden-observer"" method), duality in age regression, and the potential impact of situational cues on these phenomena. 12 high- and 9 low-susceptible undergraduates (as determined by the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale) were tested in an application of the real–simulating paradigm of hypnosis; 10 high- to medium-susceptible Ss were also employed. Inquiry into Ss' experiences was conducted through the experiential analysis technique, which involves Ss viewing and commenting on a videotape playback of their hypnotic session. Results demonstrate that neither the hidden-observer effect nor duality could be explained solely in terms of the demand characteristics of the test situation. The hidden-observer effect was observed in high-susceptible Ss only; all Ss who displayed the hidden-observer effect also displayed duality in age regression. High-susceptible Ss were distinctive in their reports of multiple levels of awareness during hypnosis. Findings are discussed in terms of the cognitive skills that Ss bring to hypnosis and the degree to which the hypnotic setting encourages the use of dissociative cognitive processes.

"314","The role of awareness in human conditioning","Reports 2 conditioning and personality experiments, employing the standard procedure of a single cue CS–UCS schedule and masking task, that assessed awareness of stimulus contingencies and demand characteristics by means of a postexperimental questionnaire. The study investigated whether thoughts about the pattern of stimulus events and expectations determine conditional responding. Ss in both experiments were recruited by newspaper advertisements and were 16–58 yrs old. Both schedules consisted of 50 acquisition trials, each block of 10 trials containing 1 unreinforced trial; 10 extinction trials were given, and the CS–UCS interval was 740 msec. Movements of the eyelid were picked up via a photoconductive high sensitivity cadmium cell and were recorded for analysis. Ss were informed that the purpose of the experiment was to measure RTs in the presence of distracting tones and airpuffs (or shocks). RTs were incorporated as a masking task to divert attention from the conditioning procedure. Results indicate no significant relationship between measures of awareness and eyelid conditioning.

Actually, each attitude survey was based on a survey completed by the S earlier in the semester. Ss were asked about their feelings about the bogus student, and some Ss were told that their responses would be judged by a lie detector, while others were told that dissimilar people like each other or that similar people like each other. Results uncovered a hint of conformity in the paper-and-pencil conditions and no hint of such an effect in the bogus pipeline conditions. Results contradict those of F. Cherry et al (see record 1977-01150-001), who found that the bogus pipeline technique was vulnerable to demand characteristics, especially among persons high in social desirability.

"318","Demand and the impact of leading questions on eyewitness testimony","E. F. Loftus and her associates (1974–1980) demonstrated that the ability of Ss to respond accurately to questioning about an event they witnessed can be systematically impaired by the interposition of misleading questions between exposure to the event and assessment of accuracy. One explanation for this low eyewitness accuracy is that it is due to demand characteristics created by the misleading questions. The present study, involving 331 undergraduates, examined this explanation using a modification of the paradigm developed by Loftus et al (see record 1978-26704-001). Results indicate that even when the final accuracy test did not easily allow Ss to accede to demand pressure, significant impairment of eyewitness accuracy was still obtained. Since this lowered accuracy did not seem due to simple compliance to demand pressure, misleading questions did interfere with subsequent eyewitness accuracy.

"320","The role of demand characteristics and hypnotic ability in dream change following a presleep instruction","Investigated the role of demand characteristics in dream change by comparing dream report change following pre- and postsleep administrations of instructions to pay attention to specific dream content. This design was based on the assumption that if presleep instructions merely distort dream reports rather than influence actual dreams, report change should be observable following a postsleep instruction. 42 undergraduates were prescreened with the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility (Form A), which allowed experimenters to examine the role of hypnotizability in dream change. Significant differences were observed only following the presleep instructions. It is concluded that report distortion as a result of paying attention to a dimension of dream content was insufficient to account for dream report change following presleep instructions. Hypnotic ability correlated significantly with the amount of dream change.

"321","The place of the human subject in the operant laboratory","Although laboratory study of human behavior seems an obvious vehicle for strengthening the scientific base of behavior analysis, the place of the human S within the operant laboratory remains problematic. The prevailing research strategy has been to link principles developed with animals to human affairs, either through interpretation of naturally occurring human behaviors or through application of the principles to the solution of human problems. The paucity of laboratory research on human operant behavior derives from several misconceptions: the possibility that experimental demand characteristics and pre-experimental behavioral dispositions of human Ss contaminate the results; that ethical considerations place undue constraint on research topics and experimental designs; and that uncontrollable variation in Ss' histories and other relevant personal characteristics prevents observation of reliable functional relations. It is argued that these problems do not pose insurmountable obstacles to the experimental analysis of human behavior; that adequate methods of control and analysis are available; and that operant techniques, by emphasizing experimentally imposed contingencies, are well suited for the laboratory study of human behavior.

"322","On the relation between laboratory experiments and social behaviour: Causal explanation and generalization","Illustrates how empiricist doctrines form the basis for the unjustifiably extreme attitudes toward experimentation in social psychology (SP). The hermeneutical critic abhors the artificiality of the traditional laboratory experiment and recommends a move toward interpretative field work; the scientific psychologist identifies such artificiality as the sine qua non of scientific practice. Three types of artificiality in SP experiments are considered: isolation, contamination, and alteration. The artificiality of isolation involves an attempt to isolate potential social psychologist mechanisms. Contamination variables include experimenter bias, demand characteristics, and evaluation apprehension. The fundamental problem in SP experiments is the artificiality of alteration, which is the removal (the artificiality of isolation) or addition (the artificiality of contamination) of constitutive SP relations that may alter the phenomenon under investigation.

The hypothesis was confirmed by data from 404 undergraduates; the RRT may provide more valid responses to items of a socially desirable and undesirable nature. The RRT deserves more attention because it can circumvent biases due to untruthful responding, demand characteristics, and evaluation apprehension as well as assure the confidentiality of the data.

Each family triad was composed of a father, mother, and an adolescent son between the ages of 12 and 17 yrs. Neurotic families manifested disturbed marital relationships, neurotic symptoms in at least one member (but no psychotic behavior or organically based symptoms), a constricted emotional climate, and/or underachievement problems in the male adolescent. Results indicate that normals were significantly more assertive than the neurotic family group. The neurotic group reported less aggressiveness than the normal families. Self-report data from the neurotic group demonstrate that they suppressed or denied their aggressive impulses more than the normals.

Ss in each condition were divided into 2 groups on the basis of their choices from a series of pictures. They were then instructed to make decisions in special matrix booklets about distributing money to others identified only by their group membership and code number. Ss were shown the title of the study, which incorporated either the term ""prediction"" or the term ""prejudice"" or no term at all. Ss also completed a postexperiment inquiry. Results show significant ingroup favoritism in control and in prejudice conditions only. There was more fairness concerning money distribution under the prediction condition. The postexperiment inquiry revealed that 64% of Ss could not remember the title of the experiment, and 77% were naive about the hypothesis. Results supply little support for the hypothesis that social categorization effects are mediated by demand characteristics. They imply that such effects are a genuine psychological reaction to ingroup–outgroup membership.

"329","The influence of demand characteristics and expectancies in the measurement of salivary response","131 college students were tested for increases or decreases in salivation under 1 of 3 conditions: (a) when told to imagine the taste of another food more or less palatable than a target food; (b) when given a placebo pill that, they were told, would alter their salivation; and (c) when given direct instructions to alter their salivation. The type of instructions Ss received altered their salivation response. Specifically, Ss told to increase salivation had higher levels than those told to decrease salivation. Results suggest that salivation measures, which have been viewed by some as refractory to demand and related effects, can be controlled. Further validation of salivation as a measure of hunger and perceived food palatability is considered necessary.

"331","On the study of statistical intuitions","The study of intuitions and errors in judgment under uncertainty is complicated by several factors: discrepancies between acceptance and application of normative rules; effects of content on the application of rules; Socratic hints that create intuitions while testing them; demand characteristics of within-S experiments; and Ss' interpretations of experimental messages according to standard conversational rules. It is argued that the positive analysis of a judgmental error in terms of heuristics may be supplemented by a negative analysis that seeks to explain why the correct rule is not intuitively compelling. A negative analysis of nonregressive prediction is outlined.

Results show that both judged-aware and judged-unaware Ss responded more positively to the stranger and inferred more similar interests if she was attitudinally similar to them. Since verbalized awareness of attitudinal similarity is not a necessary condition in a reinforcement point of view of interpersonal attraction, the overall results of the study support such a viewpoint.

In general, reseachers have been able to isolate certain here-and-now situational influences that have led to mean increases in children's sharing behavior. An important finding was that performance of a helping act is facilitated when children feel good about themselves. Few studies have attempted to isolate personal characteristics of individual children as a means of examining baseline differences of individuals across different helping behaviors. A person–situation interactional approach should be used that examines the child's family style, status in the peer group, age, demographic variables, and personality and ability as interactive with the characteristics of the particular helping situation.

An observational study was conducted during free play among Ss to identify the component skills of spontaneous cooperative play. Early techniques of spontaneous cooperation were found to be action-oriented and/or self-referenced statements contributing to thematic dialogue. Advanced techniques informed partners of abstract use of props and advised them on how to interact. A reliability study introduced dyads of older Ss to structured sets of play materials. In addition to supporting the display of components revealed in Study I, results indicated that 5-yr-olds were better able than 4-yr-olds to respond to the demand characteristics of the structured setting. Comparisons by sex, partnerships, and types of play materials were also analyzed.

"342","Nonperformance influences on performance evaluations: A laboratory phenomenon?","Reviews research that investigated the effects of nonperformance factors (i.e., gender and race) on a variety of organizational criteria, including performance evaluations. It is argued that previous findings are attributable to a research design that bears little resemblance to the performance appraisal process in real organizational contexts. 134 Black and 417 White male candidates for a police-department promotion were rated on a battery of attitude and behavior measures by 3 of the 14 Black and 18 White interviewers to examine the effects of 2 nonperformance factors (ratee and rater race) and an index of ratee past performance on performance ratings. Results of a higher-order MANOVA showed significant effects of ratee race, past performance, rater race, and a Ratee × Rater interaction. All of these sources of variance combined, however, accounted for no more than 4% of the total variance in performance ratings. Reasons for the low relationship between past performance and oral interview performance, which involve dissimilarity between rating dimensions and interview demand characteristics, are discussed. Thus, the applicability of results from past laboratory studies to performance evaluation in real organizational environments is questioned.

The present research investigated the role of other variables, such as nonverbal cues and sex of the participants involved, that may naturally accompany noise in influencing prosocial behavior. Two experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that noise alone may not reduce helping behavior. Results of the laboratory study with 51 male and 53 female undergraduates were inconclusive because of the possible interference of demand characteristics. Results of a field study with 80 male and 80 female pedestrians support the hypothesis and reveal that sex of participants involved was the major predictor of helping behavior.

Verbal skills, quantitative skills, and overlap of prior knowledge structure with essay content were treated as covariates. A number of variables related to quality of essay content and demand characteristics were controlled and/or measured to achieve the maximum possible control over recall variance. Results indicate that greater recall was associated with greater intellectual skills, greater overlap of prior knowledge, more positive attitudes toward the experimental setting, instructions to learn the essay, and the attitudinal congeniality effect (indexed by the Attitude by Essay Bias interaction). Interpretation is based on the effect of each variable on the perceived utility of the essay's content.

It was hypothesized that sex differences are not fixed in adulthood but fluctuate according to the demand characteristics of various life situations. Factor analysis of the Bem Sex-Role Inventory yielded 9 factors, providing a more precise evaluation of how desirable and undesirable aspects of instrumentality and expressivity vary throughout adulthood. The majority of effects were related to stage of family life and not age. On 1-way ANOVA, compassion and tenderness showed stage-of-life effects for both sexes, but autonomy and leadership showed effects only for men. Cross-sex-typed attributes were prominent during grandparenthood, with a rise in expressiveness for men and a rise in autonomy for women. Men were more autonomous and less acquiescent than women during expectancy and young parenthood but not at other stages. Women showed more tenderness than men at all stages except among the married-childless and grandparents. There were few sex differences across the different states of life in nonassertiveness and social inhibitions.

"350","Selection from visual persistence by perceptual groups and category membership","Six experiments with 62 university students explored whether there are alternative explanations for the fact that only physical partial-report (PR) cues produce PR superiority. Exps I and II showed that the effectiveness of physical PR cues depends on the ""goodness"" of the perceptual groups defined by the cued dimension. Results show greater PR superiorities when the demand characteristics of the cues are compatible with implied perceptual groups in the displays. Exps III and IV established that PR cues based on a category distinction produce a PR superiority when both cue onset latency and uncertainty are equated across PR and whole-report conditions. Exp V showed that the magnitude of this category PR superiority decreases systematically with increases in cue delay. Exp VI showed that PR superiorities for both physical and category cues decrease at comparable rates with increased cue delay. Results question the validity of interpretations of visual persistence that imply the existence of a literal, precategorical storage system. A multichannel view of the visual system provides a more adequate theoretical conceptualization of visual persistence.

Such faulty inferences may be made when (a) the epistemic coefficients vary across situations; (b) unintended effects occur, such as demand characteristics or experimenter effects; (c) confounding variables elicit the desired results; and (d) alternative theoretical explanations are empirically indistinguishable. The present paper critically reviews previous research on simulations and shows how faulty inferences may have arisen. It then demonstrates that some of these logical flaws are due to underidentification of the hypothesized models in simulations and experiments and can be alleviated through the use of multiple indicators.

"352","Learned helplessness as experimenter-induced failure and its alleviation with attentional redeployment","When it is recognized that laboratory studies of learned helplessness with human Ss are basically studies of experimenter-induced failure, the relevance of numerous studies of failure induction and of the theoretical models that generated them becomes apparent. The present study with 108 undergraduates adopted the assumption that cognitive interference associated with anxiety is the source of the performance decrements observed in helplessness studies. For susceptible Ss, failure experiences elicit a task-irrelevant, negative focus on self. As predicted from such a model, attentional redeployment in the form of an imagination exercise eliminated the impairment of performance that typically follows a helplessness induction. However, it was found that the effectiveness of the exercise depended on provision of a rationale to Ss. As predicted, it was found that Ss who received the exercise and rationale in the absence of a failure induction became debilitated, although this effect was only marginally significant. Results are discussed in terms of a cognitive-attentional interpretation of learned helplessness studies, and the likely role of demand characteristics is noted.

A review of relevant research indicates that studies reporting support for this hypothesis have, without exception, used within-Ss designs, and therefore only a restricted version of the hypothesis has been tested. Also, the results of some of these studies must be questioned due to demand characteristics and other problems. It is suggested that visceral feedback may make a more direct contribution to emotional processes than facial feedback and that the ""readout"" functions of facial expressions are more important than any feedback functions.

To solve these problems, the modified fishbowl format was adopted. It consisted of 4 or 5 Ss meeting in a regular interview session, with 3 or 4 others observing through a one-way mirror. Therapists decided on a session basis which members would be participants and which ones would be observers. The observers joined the participants during the last 15 min of each session and commented on their observations. Shortly after the implementation of this approach, participants began discussing therapeutically significant issues and giving each other constructive feedback. Any instances of disruptive behavior were criticized by the observers. The demand characteristics of both the participant and observer roles were the main factors in the resulting positive behavior changes.

Melzak's (1973) gate-control theory of pain: sensory discriminative (SD), motivational affective (MA), and cognitive evaluative (CE). 81 undergraduate females were pretested on the cold pressor, randomly assigned to 1 of 9 treatment conditions, and then posttested. Relaxation training (an SD procedure) produced increased tolerance, whereas distraction and imagery training (an MA procedure) resulted in higher threshold scores. Although the experimental conditions did not generate differential demand characteristics, 2 checks on independent variable manipulation revealed that SD skills were learned and employed, MA skills were already known but refined, and CE skills were largely ignored.

"357","Confirmed reservations: Mental travel","When S. M. Kosslyn et al (see record 1979-00241-001) asked Ss to scan a memorized picture, they found a strong positive linear relationship between distance scanned and reaction time. However, more recent research has suggested that this result may be as much a function of the demand characteristics of the experiment as a reflection of any structural properties of the image. To test this possibility with complex stimuli, 60 undergraduates were either presented with Kosslyn's pictorial stimuli or verbal descriptions of them in a ""nonexperiment"" and were asked to predict their scanning times. Ss were able to produce high linear correlations between scanning distance and predicted scanning time. This result is consistent with a demand characteristics explanation of the correlation between distance and reaction time that is obtained in actual image-scanning studies.

"361","Test anxiety and classroom examination performance: A reply to Daniels and Hewitt (1978)","B. Daniels and J. Hewitt (see record 1979-24695-001) reported a strong relationship between test-anxiety scores and college course examination scores, whereas earlier investigators found smaller relationships between these variables (and one study reported no significant relationship when intelligence was partialed out). Daniels and Hewitt administered the test-anxiety measure immediately after a course examination, whereas the other investigators administered the test-anxiety measures at a different time. In the present study the Test Anxiety Scale was administered to 40 undergraduate students immediately after a course examination and to 50 other students after a regular class period. A significant relationship between test-anxiety and examination scores was obtained only for the former group, and no significant relationship was found for either group when intelligence was partialed out. Thus, the high relationship obtained by Daniels and Hewitt may have resulted at least in part from their students' test-anxiety levels being altered due to their having just completed a course examination and from their response to demand characteristics inherent in the experimental procedure.

Nonorthogonal multivariate ANOVA indicated that in all cases the ratings were above the midpoint of the scale and that the pattern of results was consistent across all areas of psychology and across all degrees of experimenter experience. EP, EX, and PC were rated highest (range of means 8.6–9.9), followed by EV (range of means 5.9–8.6).

"364","Verbal proficiency: A confounding variable in the reliability of children's attitude scales?","To investigate the role of verbal ability/IQ in the reliability of children's attitude scales, 309 children (mean age 120.24 mo) were divided into 8 groups on the basis of their scores in the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Ss completed the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control (LOC) Scale (which has items formulated as sentences) and the Children's Psychological Conservatism Scale (the items of which are presented in catch-phrase format). Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient was computed for each of the 8 groups on both scales. Results demonstrate a curvilinear relationship between verbal ability and the reliability of the LOC scale, while no discernible relationship categorized that between verbal proficiency and Cronbach's alpha on the conservatism scale. It is argued that these results emerged on the LOC scale alone since it required considerably more verbal proficiency, and 2 reasons are advanced for this phenomenon: Ss with greater verbal ability perceived more ambiguity in these items and were more susceptible to implicit demand characteristics.

"365","Parent, child, and reciprocal influences","Research in the 1960s demonstrated the capabilities of infants and the demand characteristics of their behavior. These data, together with the failure of studies directed exclusively to parent effects on children, have led to a reformulation of socialization theory to encompass the reciprocal influences of parent and offspring. The cognitive capabilities, knowledge, and attitudes of parents assume a more important role in this theory. New research approaches are now available that can isolate parent and child effects, thus providing the foundation needed for identifying reciprocal influences. If research fills in the outline of this new perspective, and the viewpoint is communicated to parents, it should facilitate parent–child interaction. Previous theories, all too often given extreme expression in the mass media, have adversely affected the functioning of parents, either causing them to feel too much responsibility for their children's development, or leading them to mistake permissiveness for parental involvement and commitment. The reformulation should attenuate these extreme formulations, because neither of the latter is consistent with the concept of reciprocal influences.

Three indices of persistence were used: (1) time spent in an attempt to solve puzzles, (2) number of attempts to solve the puzzles, and (3) willingness to return later for a similar experiment. The 1st 2 were experimental session indices, the latter, a postsession index. Neither of the session indices was related to locus of control or set. Willingness to return was strongly related to a skill set among internal Ss and to a chance set among external Ss. These differences are interpreted in terms of situational demand characteristics and extrinsic motivation.

"367","Effects of cognitive-adjunct treatments on assertiveness","Examined additive effects of 2 cognitive-adjunct treatments (CADs) to behavioral rehearsal (BR): cognitive self-statement training (CSST) and attribution training (AT). Demand characteristics associated with behavioral, role-play assessments were also investigated. 32 female and 10 male unassertive undergraduates (self-reports and Conflict Resolution Inventory Scores) were randomly assigned to treatment groups with at least 2 males in each group. Within each group, the 14 Ss were randomly assigned to either high or low demand during behavioral assessment. All Ss received 2 individual training sessions and were assessed pre-, immediately post-, 6 wks post-, and 13 wks posttreatment. During Session 1, all Ss received identical BR procedures; Session 2 constituted either a CAD or more BR. Self-report indices included the Conflict Resolution Inventory, Adult Nowicki-Strickland Internal–External Control Scale, Irrational Beliefs Test, and Assertive Self-Statement Test. For behavioral role-play measures (i.e., the Behavioral Role Play Test and the Extended Interaction Test), demand instructions were introduced at each assessment phase. For pretreatment behavioral differences, results show a significant Demand main effect on the role play measures. Results indicate that the CSST was the only group associated with maintenance and generalization of assertive responses and that high instructional demands appear to facilitate performance.

"368","Demand characteristics in observations of marital interaction","Examined the susceptibility of marital observations to purposeful faking with 40 middle-class volunteer distressed and nondistressed couples. Behavioral observations of couples' problem-solving behavior during a conflict-eliciting task were obtained, first, under neutral instructions and, second, under instructions to either act happy or to act distressed. Under neutral instructions, distressed and nondistressed couples were correctly identified on 5 out of 6 behavioral dimensions from the Marital Interaction Coding System (MICS). Under instructions to fake good or fake bad, the verbal behavior of both couple types differed significantly from their behavior under neutral instructions; however, positive and negative nonverbal behaviors did not change. When instructed to fake, distressed and nondistressed couples differed on 4 out of 5 of the behavioral dimensions on which they had differed under neutral instructions. Evidence for differential responsiveness of marital types to faking instructions was limited and evident only in a linear combination of MICS behavior dimensions. The implications of these findings for previously published marital research are discussed, and the importance of nonverbal behavior for outcome assessment and theoretical understanding of marital interaction is stressed.

"369","The effectiveness of a pacifist strategy in conflict resolution: An experimental study","To find out to what extent the violence and exploitative behavior of the opponent of a pacifist strategist could be controlled, the author tested within a laboratory context the impact of eight variables. Together these variables accounted for more than 50% of the behavior of the opponents. The predictions concerning the controlled variables were confirmed. A pacifist strategy tends to be most effective in reducing violence and exploitative behavior when the human distance between the subject and opponent is small, the subject is well informed about the intentions of the pacifist, the subject is required to justify his behavior post-facto, and when a partial third party is present. Male and female subjects did not differ with respect to the use of violence, but it was found that females had a higher propensity to stalemate, with a consequent reduction of their own and the pacifist's winnings. The strongest predictors of the effectiveness of the pacifist strategy were the demand characteristics and the image of the pacifist held by the opponent. A discussion of the controllability of these last two variables is included.

"370","The effects of carbon monoxide on dual-task performance","30 18–26 yr old nonsmokers were exposed for 4 hrs to 1 of 3 concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO)—5 ppm, 35 ppm, and 70 ppm—to produce blood levels of either 1, 3, or 5% carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) after the 3rd hr of exposure. Performance was assessed by a tracking task paired with a peripheral monitoring task, each possessing 2 levels of difficulty. Results indicate that visual-manual tracking was significantly impaired by about 30% during the 4th hr of exposure to 70 ppm of CO (when 5% COHb was reached) as compared to performance at 5 and 35 ppm. The impairment occurred only during the high frequency tracking condition. Ss' response times to the peripheral light-intensity changes also increased during the 3rd and 4th hrs. Findings suggest that an assessment of the effects of low-level CO on human performance should include an analysis of the demand characteristics of the tasks and data on concentration and exposure duration.

The results of the first ""mental travel"" experiment that pitted verbal vs imagery coding showed that (a) the positive correlation between physical distance and reaction time (RT) was replicated; and (b) when given a choice, Ss' RTs varied as a function of verbal codes rather than imagery. To isolate the effects due to demand constraints from those produced by mode dominance, a nonexperiment in which Ss received only a description of the image-scanning procedure was conducted. Results demonstrated that Ss were capable of predicting the RT results for both verbal and imagery codes.

"373","Distraction, counterarguing and the internalization of attitude change","Examined the hypothesis that distraction during a persuasive communication enhances the resulting attitude change by disrupting counterarguing. Although previous research using T. C. Brock's (see record 1967-15215-001) postcommunication counterarguing index has shown that distraction inhibits counterarguing, the relationship was reevaluated in the present experiments with 210 undergraduates, using a more direct measure of counterarguing. The direct measure was shown to increase with distraction, contradicting hypotheses that attribute the distraction effect to counterarguing disruption. With a wide range of distraction, Brock's measure was nonmonotonically related to distraction. Since observed attitude change is also predicted to be nonmonotonically related to distraction, Brock's index was interpreted as a correlate rather than a mediator of measured attitude change. Results suggest that distraction actually inhibits internalization of the message and that the apparently enhancing effects of distraction are a result of the demand characteristics and/or evaluation apprehension created by the experimental task of paying attention to both a message and a distractor. Implications for the theoretical role of counterarguing in mediating the internalization of persuasive communication are discussed.

Each S was tested individually for suggestibility, using the Barber Suggestibility Scale under task-motivational conditions. The percentage overweight was estimated for each S and correlated with the Objective and Subjective suggestibility scores. The correlations were not significant, and suggestibility did not increase in obesity. When the suggestibility scores for the obese Ss were compared with the scores obtained by normal and obese Ss by other investigators, it was clear that obese Ss' levels of suggestibility were no greater than those for the general population.

Ss who were informed (via a peer confederate) prior to exposure to an aggressive film that the E expected their aggression to increase behaved more aggressively following the film than Ss who were told their aggression was expected to decrease or Ss assigned to an uninformed control condition. The effect was strongest for Ss favorably disposed toward participation in psychology experiments. Results indicate that willing participants are concerned about complying with demand characteristics, but only when they think E's hypothesis is reasonable. Awareness of an expectancy for heightened aggression was necessary for instructions to identify with the film aggressor while viewing the film to enhance aggression.

"382","Objective workload and behavioural response in airport radar control rooms","Previous research by the authors indicated that peak traffic and the duration of radio-communications were good predictors of behavioral response of air traffic controllers (ATCs) working in air route traffic control centers. The present study investigated if these 2 measures of workload were generalizable to controllers working in radar facilities serving major airports. 3,110 observations were made on radar sectors at the 13 major radar control rooms in the US. A large number of air traffic variables and communication tasks were measured. Behavioral ratings were made by expert-observer ATCs. Results replicate previous findings that peak traffic and the duration of radio-communications functioned as behavioral stressors. Time monitoring and stand-by time also were found to predict behavioral responses. Careful consideration of these and other results led to the conclusion that peak traffic is the most generalizable environmental stressor for ATC behavior, whereas the other workload measures are more correctly viewed as concomitants of the demand characteristics of ATC work.

Taffel's (see record 1957-02490-001) procedure in which Ss beginning sentences with certain personal pronouns were verbally reinforced by the experimenter (E). In Exp I, Ss showed a significant increase in performance, using ""I"" as the criterion. Most of them were conscious of the contents of the sentences, as hypothesized. Ss giving no attention to the reinforcing stimulus showed more performance than those giving attention. When the E made an explicit demand to increase performance, awareness increased cooperation. It was concluded that Ss did not behave in compliance with the demands of the E but with egocentric characteristics of their own. In Exp II, using the third-person pronoun as the criterion instead of ""I,"" Ss showed no increment. Results are discussed from the viewpoint of the demand characteristics.

An examination of the elements of that issue in relation to available research methodologies indicates, however, that the issue is not empirically resolvable.

"387","Experimental research as practical action: Stooge detection and bias","A discussion of experimental research as practical action applies the ethnomethodological critique to research in experimental social psychology. While research on demand characteristics may meet some of the ethnomethodological criticisms, it may not provide a set of exemplars around which the practical activity of experimentation can be organized. ""Stooge detection"" is a practical problem often faced by experimenters. The author's data suggests that stooge detection may, in certain circumstances, be a member's strategy for dealing with a problematic experimental setting. This view has implications for notions of experimental ""bias."" One of the more comprehensible elements in ethnomethodology is the critique of ""normative sociology"" and its attendant methodology. This paper considers the applicability of this critique to research in contemporary experimental social psychology. After a brief summary of the critique, it proposes a view of experimental research as practical activity, as rooted in a pragmatic knowledge base. In the light of such considerations, it then treats the issue of ""stooge detection"" as an example of a practical problem encountered in small group studies of reactions to ""deviance"" or non-conformity.

"390","Semantic integration of verbal information into a visual memory","In 5 experiments and a pilot study, a total of 1,232 undergraduates watched a series of slides depicting a single auto–pedestrian accident. The purpose of these experiments was to investigate how information supplied after an event influences a witness's memory for that event. Ss were exposed to either consistent, misleading, or irrelevant information after the accident event. Results show that misleading information produced less accurate responding on both a yes–no and a 2-alternative forced-choice recognition test. Further, misleading information had a larger impact if introduced just prior to a final test rather than immediately after the initial event. The effects of misleading information cannot be accounted for by a simple demand-characteristics explanation. Overall results suggest that information to which a witness is exposed after an event, whether that information is consistent or misleading, is integrated into the witness's memory of the event.

Data from half of the Ss were collected by a recovering alcoholic; data from the other half of the Ss were collected by a nonalcoholic. When the recovering alcoholic served as experimenter, AA was rated as more socially desirable than group therapy and group therapy was rated significantly higher on negative attributes than AA. When the nonalcoholic served as experimenter, group therapy and AA were rated about equally. Ss significantly reported to the recovering alcoholic that they preferred AA as the treatment of choice; conversely, they reported to the nonalcoholic that they preferred group therapy as the treatment of choice. The differences in alcoholics' perceptions of group therapy and AA are highlighted and discussed in terms of demand characteristics.

Frey (see record 1970-14595-001) have proposed that a relatively large number of Ss within certain experiments will adopt a faithful S role, that is, they will intentionally avoid basing their behavior on any suspicions they may have regarding the experimenter's hypothesis. Examination of the studies on which this conclusion was based, however, casts doubt on whether Fillenbaum's Ss were truly faithful or whether they may have become aware of the nature of the deception after all opportunity for awareness to influence their responses had passed. To test this hypothesis, awareness measures were administered to Ss (40 male undergraduates) either before they took an incidental learning test or (as in Fillenbaum's studies) after the test. As predicted, fewer Ss were classified as faithful in the 1st condition than in the 2nd. It is concluded that, in fact, very few if any Ss are actively faithful. Problems associated with role analyses of S behavior are discussed.

T. Orne's (1962) concept ""demand characteristics of the experimental situation."" Human Ss may be expected to be sensitive to the demands of the norms operating in the experiment. A 5-step mediational model is proposed to explain how various sources of artifacts may interact to produce compliance, noncompliance, or countercompliance with demand characteristics. Treatment methods for reducing artifact influences are suggested, including ""blind"" procedures and unobtrusive measures.

According to the mere-exposure hypothesis, the S should prefer her mirror image, whereas the S's friend should prefer the S's true image. A single frontal facial photograph of each S was printed in such a way that one print corresponded to the S's true image and another to her mirror image.

The results obtained were attributed to the use of the VVIQ and pictures with a high degree of vividness in the memory task. These findings were disconfirmed in 2 experiments in which the VVIQ was used and vivid pictures were presented in the memory tasks. In each experiment 48 undergraduates were to judge whether pairs of similar, successively presented pictures were identical or not. Results indicate that Ss rated as ""good"" imagers did not perform differently from those rated as ""poor"" imagers. The influences of demand characteristics in the previous experiments and differences in experimental procedures are referred to as possible causes of the observed inconsistencies in results.

Evidence that initial hypnotic susceptibility level may limit the degree to which hypnotizability may be modified (including the frequent finding of high correlations between pre- and postmodification hypnotizability scores) is noted as a major paradox stemming from modification studies that requires greater attention. Until these methodological issues are treated more thoroughly than hitherto, claims for modifiability need to be treated with caution. Since hypnotic responsivity involves both aptitudinal and attitudinal components, future research in this field needs to develop strategies for determining the degree to which each is altered by modification training procedures.

Two studies were conducted to establish whether these criticisms are justified and to find solutions to these problems. Both studies established the validity of the criticisms by demonstrating that the presentation of presently used Michigan negligence instructions is about as effective in helping jurors understand the laws as the presentation of no instructions at all. It was found that by rewriting these instructions in accordance with empirical knowledge of what elements affect perception, memory, and comprehension of language, their effectiveness was significantly improved. Furthermore, it was found that the presentation of instructions both at the beginning and at the end of a case would allow jurors a greater opportunity to focus their attention on relevant evidence and to remember it. The studies demonstrate the urgent need for jurisdictions around the country to improve the way jury instructions are written and delivered, if they expect jurors to reach verdicts in light of the law rather than in ignorance of it.

"408","The stimulating and inhibiting effects of weapons on aggressive behavior","Evidence is presented indicating that firearms violence is an important social problem. Research suggests that the effectiveness of firearms as a cause of death and injury may be due to their widespread availability, their lethality, and the impulsivity of their use. The investigation of a possible causal link between firearms and impulsive aggression led to L. Berkowitz and A. LePage's (1967) weapons effect experiment which suggested that weapons can increase the instigation to aggression in aroused and uninhibited individuals. It was reasoned that weapons might stimulate aggression by classical conditioning processes resulting from learned associations between aggressive acts and weapons. Although a few studies have failed to reproduce an aggression-enhancing effect of weapons, the original finding has been replicated in several countries with diverse S groups in both field and laboratory settings. However, these studies also indicate that many individuals may react with anxiety or fear in the presence of weapons and inhibit aggressive reactions. Manipulations of evaluation apprehension, S suspiciousness, and/or hypothesis awareness about the purpose of the weapons in the experiments all seem to lead to reduced levels of aggressive response in the presence of weapons. These findings offer a possible explanation for the few failures to replicate the original weapons effect; if researchers used apprehensive Ss or Ss who were aware of possible experimental deceptions, they were more likely to observe an inhibitory reaction than an aggression-enhancing effect of weapons.

It was found that coaches, Black players, and White players agreed regarding such characteristics but that the magnitude of agreement varied significantly from one position to the other. Although almost all the coaches in the sample were Whites, correlations indicated that Black players were somewhat more in agreement with the coaches than White players. Thus, difficulties between Black players and White coaches must be due to other reasons than different opinions about position requirements.

To alleviate dependence on subjective verbal reports in the present study, 3 male college student volunteers who were highly hypnotizable (on the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale, Form C) were given hypnotic instructions to have a nocturnal emission involving suggested, sexually stimulating material. Ss' bed clothes showed no evidence of seminal stains following either night of experimental treatment, although one dream of symbolically sexual content was verbally reported.

"412","Assessing the reassessment of the validity of laboratory-produced attitude change","G. L. Wells (see record 1978-30720-001) claims that the results of C. Hendrick and B. Seyfried's (see record 1974-30073-001) study are due to demand characteristics in the sense that the Ss in the latter study might have shown pseudo-attitude-change and subsequently given bogus attraction responses consistent with the pseudo-attitude-change. Wells bases his argument on the experimental findings that the Ss who did not receive an attitude posttest were more similar to control Ss in attraction responses than to Ss who did receive an attitude posttest. In the present experiment, 24 triplets of undergraduates who were yoked on an attitude pretest (Student Opinion Survey) were exposed to a persuasive message. Two Ss in each triplet completed a relevant attitude posttest, and the 3rd an irrelevant posttest. The next day all Ss evaluated 3 stimulus strangers on attraction; within each triplet there was a pretest stranger and 2 strangers identical to the 2 attitude patterns obtained from the 2 relevant posttest Ss. Results support the hypothesis that variability in the patterning of attitude posttest responses accounted for Wells's attraction data and the discrepancy between his data and the Hendrick and Seyfried study.

From 103 introductory psychology students who participated in a replication of an earlier verbal conditioning experiment by M. M. Page (see record 1973-02366-001), 92 were randomly selected for the final study. It was found that only Ss aware of the purpose of the conditioning study appeared to ""condition."" Ss' awareness was assessed by a series of converging questions which were content analyzed by 2 judges and coded to yield a total awareness score. The expectation that dogmatism and field dependence would interact to affect levels of awareness was confirmed.

A trace of evidence for predicted amnesia effects occurred with only 1 out of 6 intensively trained, highly susceptible college students. Results are compatible with the view that (a) suggested recall amnesia produces a disturbance of the retrieval process similar to source amnesia, and (b) indirect associational measures then merely serve to stimulate retrieval.

"418","Experimenter expectancy effects","A review of findings of recent studies of nonverbal cues that mediate experimenter (E) expectancy effects suggests the need for a model integrating the diverse approaches utilized. Evidence indicates that paralinguistic cues convey information about the the E's expectation, while visual behaviors affect the participant's mood. The cues provide a basis for responding when evaluation apprehension is aroused in the participant. R. L. Rosnow's (see record 1974-05067-001) adaptation of a model used by W. J. McGuire (1968, 1969) in discussing attitude change produced by persuasive communications, is proposed to integrate research findings on E expectancy effects. The model proposes that the 3 mediating stages of receptivity, motivation, and capacity occur between the demand characteristics of the experimental situation and occurrence of the participant's response. A participant motivated for acquiescence or counteracquiescence who is capable of making the ""demanded"" response maps must adequately receive a demand signal. Differentiation of attention and comprehension in the receptivity stage of the model is suggested.

Overall, males displayed significantly less avoidance as well as more frequent snake contact and task completion than females, although the sex differences held only among high fear Ss and no sex effect was found on other measures (a modified Timed Behavioral Checklist and the Anxiety Differential). Reported fear level was significantly associated with latency to touch, approach score, touch frequency, and task completion (high fear Ss displayed less boldness) but, on all measures except latency, this was true only for female Ss. High demand conditions produced significantly more approach, target contact, and task completion than low demand.

In Exp II, 116 students who had taken one or more previous psychology courses and had been in at least 2 experiments (""sophisticated"" Ss) were run, and a satiation-deprivation effect was obtained.

Television violence is unrelated to harmful aggression is the proposition advanced by these authors. They reach it after a thorough review of the scientific literature that obviously included an arduous effort to cover the most recent studies available skeptics. The experiments demonstrating that exposure to aggressive televised models result in the acquisition of and in some circumstances the display of observed aggression are rejected because the situation involves a target appropriate for attack, such as a Bobo doll. The experiments demonstrating that aggression different in kind from what was observed is increased by such exposure are rejected because of the possibility that ""demand characteristics"" of the situation are responsible--subjects deliver what they guess the experimenter wants. Oddly, such arguments that the results do not apply to real life because of the absence of sanctions against aggression and that the immediacy of measurement is uninformative about long-range effects are left undiscussed.

Such results, in conjunction with D. J. Bem's 1972 findings that Ss infer their attitude from the external circumstances of their behavior, suggested that false feedback of belief or disbelief would affect persuasion. In the present experiment, 108 female college students listened to a speech while observing their (false) reactions on a ""belief meter."" Half of the Ss received strong positive belief feedback, and the other half received strong disbelief feedback. Demand characteristics were varied by telling half of the Ss in each group that the meter was highly reliable and valid and the other half that it was of questionable validity. Results show that the meter feedback affected self-attributions of attitude. Ss receiving disbelief feedback rated their attitude the same as 36 controls who merely completed the attitude scale.

"427","Attitude formation and mere exposure phenomena: A nonartifactual explanation of empirical findings","Used infrequent positive (E+) and negative (E-) words as stimuli in 2 exposure experiments with 60 college students. Increased exposure led E+ words to become more positive and E- words to become more negative. Exposure also led the summed evaluations of the associations to E+ and E- words to become, respectively, more positive and more negative. These parallel findings were predicted from an attitude formation process that was based on M. Fishbein's (1967) attitude model. Explanations of response competition, mental sets, attitude conditioning, demand characteristics, S hypotheses, and relative rating strategies were also tested. None of these explanations could account for the exposure effects. It is concluded that mere exposure effects are not necessarily artifacts and that the attitude formation process can potentially reconcile inconsistent findings in the literature.

Their Ss were subjected to a variant of SD, in which a procedure aimed at stimulating a fantasy of ""merging with mother"" was substituted for muscle relaxation. This procedure consisted of the tachistoscopic subliminal exposure of the symbiotic gratification stimulus ""Mommy and I are one"" (experimental) or neutral stimulus ""people walking"" (control). The aim of the present study was to replicate their work with special reference to demand characteristics, using as Ss 20 snake-phobic undergraduates. SD with a symbiotic gratification stimulus was not more effective than SD with a neutral stimulus, which may be explained by the fact that the neutral stimulus in the present study ""snake and I are one"" was more relevant than the neutral stimulus in the Silverman et al study.

The methodological problems with this research include the failure of investigators to evaluate the experiential impact of expectancy-inducing instructions, the use of unconvincing placebo manipulations, and the predominant employment of mildly fearful, poorly motivated Ss. In spite of these problems, it is tentatively concluded that expectancy manipulations are important change mediators. Several mechanisms may explain how expectancy mediates change, including increased compliance with real treatment procedures; increased tendency to test reality after having undergone an ""effective"" therapy, with subsequent fear extinction and self-reinforcement for behavioral improvement; modification of demand characteristics after treatment; and modification of cognitive events controlling fear responding.

"436","Effects of supply and demand on ratings of object value","In 2 experiments, a total of 200 female undergraduates rated the value and attractiveness of cookies that were either in abundant supply or scarce supply. In the scarce condition, the cookies were either constantly scarce or they began in abundant supply and then decreased. Ss were told that this decrease in supply was either due to an accident or to a high demand for the cookies. In the abundant condition, the cookies were either constantly abundant or first scarce and then abundant. The increase in supply was either due to an accident or to a lack of demand for the cookies. These conditions were crossed with a manipulation in which Ss thought either a high or low number of additional Ss were still to participate in the study. Results indicate that (a) cookies in scarce supply were rated as more desirable than cookies in abundant supply; (b) cookies were rated as more valuable when their supply changed from abundant to scarce than when they were constantly scarce; and (c) cookies scarce because of high demand were rated higher than cookies that were scarce because of an accident. With regard to abundance, cookies that were constantly abundant were rated higher than cookies that began scarce but later became abundant. Results extend commodity theory. Reactance was hypothesized as an intervening process responsible for some of the results. The 2nd study was performed to rule out the possibility that demand characteristics were responsible for the obtained results.

"439","Ways by which outcome measures influence outcomes in classroom behavior modification research","Identifies 3 ways by which outcome measures influence outcomes in classroom behavior modification studies. Inadequacies in selecting a dependent variable are attributed to the lack of fit between the conceptual category system used by the behavior modifier and that used by the referral agent in the classroom. Recommendations for modifying the selection process are made which include the use of reciprocal target behavior, the incorporation of special control Ss for whom the response is not problematical, and the simultaneous assessment of attitude and behavior change responses. Reliability characteristics of the dependent variable are examined from the point of view of demand characteristics operating within the recording situation and statistical efforts peculiar to the analysis of recorded data. The utility of outcome measures are examined from the point of view of their impact on influencing others in the applied research environment.

"440","Levels of dogmatism and willingness to report ""hippie"" and ""straight"" shoplifters: A field experiment accompanied by home interviews","Conducted a field experiment accompanied by follow-up home interviews of 135 21-74 yr old shoppers. The field experiment involved rigged shoplifting incidents in which the shoplifter's appearance (hippie vs straight) was manipulated. In the interviews, Ss were tested on Trodahl and Powell's shortened version of the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale; another scale measured social distance attitudes toward hippies. High and low dogmatics did not differ in their reporting of hippie and straight shoplifters, even though high dogmatics exhibited higher social distance attitudes toward hippies. It is concluded that since the responses toward persons in actual interaction situations entail demand characteristics different than responses to case descriptions, high dogmatics may have been more offended by shoplifting and hippie shoplifters, but in the highly problematic situation represented by the shoplifting incidents their disapproval was not manifested behaviorally.

"442","Disclosing oneself to a stranger: Reciprocity and its limits","Conducted 2 experiments on the determinants of self-disclosure between strangers in airport departure lounges. In Exp I, 160 male and 160 female adults in an airport lounge were asked to provide either ""handwriting samples"" or written ""self-descriptions."" 5 male and 5 female students served as Es in both studies. More intimate and longer disclosures were provided in the self-description condition. Ss in the self-description condition also tended to reciprocate the intimacy level of the E's prior disclosure to a greater degree. Results are attributed to a process of modeling, in response to the demand characteristics of the situation. Exp II employed the handwriting paradigm to probe the limits of self-disclosure reciprocity, using 117 male and 119 female adults at the same airport. E first disclosed himself at either a low, medium, or high level of intimacy, and he did so either nonpersonalistically (he simply copied a standard message) or personalistically (he pretended to create the message specifically for the S). It was predicted that in the nonpersonalistic conditions Ss would again model the E's level of intimacy. In the personalistic conditions, however, considerations of trust were expected to supplement or supplant the modeling mechanism. Results with respect to the length of the Ss' messages conformed closely to the predicted pattern. In Exp II, out-of-town visitors wrote longer messages than did local residents, suggesting the operation of a ""passing stranger"" effect.

"444","The influence of demand characteristics on the outcome of systematic desensitization analogue studies","48 female undergraduates with high scores on the Snake-Fear Questionnaire participated in either systematic desensitization, sleep therapy, partial systematic desensitization, or no treatment. Sleep therapy and partial systematic desensitization had all of the components of systematic desensitization except pairing the hierarchy and relaxation. However, sleep therapy Ss took the posttreatment fear assessments thinking that relaxation and the hierarchy had been paired while they slept, whereas Ss in partial systematic desensitization took the posttherapy fear assessments with the expectation of subsequently having relaxation paired with the hierarchy. Results indicate that comparable fear reductions were produced by sleep therapy and systematic desensitization. Sleep therapy, however, resulted in more reduction of the Ss' fear responses than partial systematic desensitization. These findings demonstrate that pairing relaxation with the hierarchy was not necessary to achieve reduction of Ss' fear responses, and that operations other than the components of systematic desensitization could influence the outcome of systematic desensitization analog research. Findings support the contention that in analog research a significant amount of the behavior change achieved by systematic desensitization is attributable to the treatment's demand characteristics.

Ss were 160 undergraduates. It was hypothesized that the effects found by Sigall et al would be greater for Ss whose E was their instructor than for Ss whose E was not their instructor. Results do not support the hypothesis. Contrary to the Sigall et al findings, Ss in the present study showed increases in performance even when such increases suggested, from the E's point of view, that the Ss were obsessive-compulsive. Interview data indicated that the average S reportedly believed he was supposed to excel in task performance and performed accordingly. The Sigall et al procedure is discussed from both the E's and the Ss' point of view.

"446","Attribution of behavioral intentions to obese and normal-weight stimulus persons","Examined the relationship between the attribution of traits and the attribution of short-term, situation-specific intentions and probable behaviors, with particular reference to the perception of obese persons. 144 male and female college students performed 1 of 4 tasks: (a) rating photographs of obese and normal-weight female faces for likeability and attractiveness; (b) attributing short-term intentions and probable behaviors to these stimulus persons within the context of briefly described social interactions; (c) judging the situationally determined demand characteristics of the intentions and probable behaviors; or (d) judging the ""meaning "" of the intentions or behaviors in terms of trait scales. Although the obese faces were consistently rated as significantly less likeable and less attractive than the normal-weight faces, only a few differences were found in the situation-specific intentions or behaviors attributed to the 2 groups. It is suggested that impression-formation measured in terms of global, dispositional characteristics cannot be assumed to directly predict many differences in behavioral expectations in specific interpersonal settings. An ""obese personality"" stereotype emerged, consisting either of socially undesirable traits or traits of ambiguous social desirability. Implications for an interactive model of situational vs personality determinants of expected behavior are discussed.

The cold pressor test provided the experimental procedure for all Ss. In Exp I, with 64 female undergraduates, ice water tolerance was greater with an explicit written contract than with oral instructions conveying the same content. After interpolated experience with the E, Ss who believed they had failed to meet contract conditions tolerated ice water longer than those who believed the E failed to meet conditions. In Exp II, 48 Ss anticipating reinforcement for contract fulfillment tolerated the ice water longer than Ss who were not reinforced or who received reinforcement contingent only on contract making. In Exp III with 96 Ss, examination of the magnitude of intention to tolerate ice water revealed that presence of the aversive cues associated with the task and high probability of demands to fulfill the contract significantly lowered commitments. Delay of onset of the task only weakly (p &lt; .10) affected commitment; short-delay eliciting reduced estimates of tolerance. Results are discussed in relation to demand characteristics and reconceptualization of self-control that stresses the importance of situational variables and Ss' commitments to future action.

This resulted in a ""mirror image"" reversal of the data for this group as compared to the regular group. This reversal was accounted for by aware Ss only. Unaware Ss could not follow the reversal instructions, and they did not show a conditioning-without-awareness effect. In the 2nd study, Ss were instructed to learn the associations between the conditioned stimulus-unconditioned stimulus lists. This resulted in a large increase in the magnitude of the attitude conditioning effect.

Spider phobics showed significantly faster heart rate, greater heart-rate variability, and vasoconstriction during spider slide presentations than nonphobics. Spider phobics also showed more frequent phasic skin responses but not larger skin response amplitudes to spider slides. Respiration rate and respiration amplitude were not significantly different for the 2 groups. It appears that while a general autonomic nervous system arousal occurs during a spider-phobic reaction, the demand characteristics of the phobic situation seem to determine which physiological responses are most affected.

Level of demand for approach was varied by presenting the test as a measure of avoidance (Low Demand; L) or a measure of physiological reaction which required that Ss handle the target object (High Demand; H). All Ss were tested twice, half under the same level of demand and half under increased or decreased demand. On the 1st BAT, the H condition resulted in more approach and less overt fear behavior. Treatment volunteers showed significantly less approach, more overt fear, and longer latencies to touch. The main effect of repeated testing was significant for all behavioral measures, and the Treatment * Time interaction was significant for approach and overt fear measures. Ss displayed less fear on the 2nd as opposed to the 1st BAT. Results are discussed in terms of 3 aspects of outcome research.

Ss were administered a behavioral avoidance test under instructional orientations designed to vary situational demand characteristics. Ss run under a condition in which the demand characteristics favored approach behaviors showed significantly more approach than did a group run under demand characteristics designed to dampen approach behaviors, and also differed significantly in frequency of performing the terminal behavior from Ss run under a traditional instructional orientation. 100% of the Ss in the former condition performed the terminal behavior. Significant decreases in self-reported fear of rats following the test were observed in all groups, but these changes were not accompanied by attitudinal changes. Analyses of physiological and self-report measures of fear obtained during the test suggest that demand characteristics affect approach rather than avoidance motivation.

Later, each S had a socially sanctioned opportunity to shock his partner, ostensibly to evaluate an essay written by him. Another 32 Ss were included as simulating controls who did not receive shocks.

Pre-post measures of alcohol consumption and attitudes toward alcohol were obtained using an analog ""taste test"" assessment procedure. No statistically significant differences in reduced alcohol consumption or attitudes toward alcohol were found among the groups.

"472","Hypnosis, attribution, and demand characteristics","Discusses 2 strategies of hypnosis research. It is argued that T. X. Barber's positivistic use of the experimental method is methodologically blind to cognitions or cognitive states of awareness. As a result, repeated demonstrations of input-output effects are not the same as evidence which regards the hypnotic state as scientifically vacuous. M. T. Orne's simulator methodology is considered to be an attempt to refer outcome effects to state, rather than situational, variables. The relationship of simulator paradigms to attribution theory (i.e., that S's awareness of situational influences on his behavior is of central importance) is considered. Whether an S is aware of the demand characteristics of a situation is viewed as a critical but previously unrecognized issue. The distinction between recognized and unrecognized demand characteristics is discussed in terms of findings that hypnotic Ss appear less sensitive than simulator Ss to situational characteristics.

Ss were informed via false electronic feedback that they were either sexually aroused, aggressively aroused, or aroused through the action of a drug (placebo) ingested previously. All Ss were then given a choice between shocking the confederate and examining a number of photographs of attractive female nudes. Ss who had been informed that they were either aggressively aroused or aroused by the drug preferred to shock the confederate. Ss who had been told that they were sexually aroused showed a preference for looking at nudes. Ss who behaved in ways consistent with feedback on their arousal state were more confident of their decisions than Ss who behaved inconsistently.

The 1st, demand characteristics, suggests that pretesting triggers an awareness of the E's manipulatory intent when questionnaires are followed by persuasive communications and then by other questionnaires containing virtually the same items that appeared on the pretest. The 2nd, S commitments, argues that Ss may become ""frozen"" in their original positions to commit themselves to a serious controversial issue. 300 male and 201 female undergraduates were randomly assigned to 4 groups. The 1st group received the pretest and the treatment, a 2nd group only the pretest, a 3rd group only the treatment, and a 4th group served as a control; all groups received the posttest. The treatment consisted of a 388-word communication represented as an excerpt from the New York Times. The data were analyzed by a 5-way analysis of variance on composite posttest scores. Factors included sex, volunteer status, anonymity pretesting, and experimental vs. control. Composite scores were obtained by adding item factor scores from factors having eigen values greater than 1.

A significant effect for demand cues was found, along with a significant Demand Cues * Evaluation Apprehension interaction effect. This was interpreted as illustrating the basic flaw in the laboratory attitude-change experiment; demand characteristics are confounded with the impact of communication.

"479","Controls in cross-cultural experimentation","Points out that cross-cultural research is like other psychological research in the 3 categories of controls that it considers. With respect to stimulus or independent variables, comparability must be insured. Control of S variables calls for randomness of selection or for a particular state in the Ss under investigation. Measurement or recording of the dependent variable requires taking into account possible constant errors and random errors. Cross-cultural research also has special problems of its own; e.g., persons in non-Western cultures do not always perceive as persons in Western cultures do, and at times it is not certain whether they are attending to the stimulus intended for them. Attention to previous learning, to sequential effects, to artificiality of the situation, and to special demand characteristics within one culture that are not found in others. provides challenge at the locus of the S. Since the same behavior may mean quite different things in different cultures, deciding which responses will be measured, and how, creates further problems for cross-cultural research.

The prediction that suspicious Ss would be more positive in their attitudes on the PRS than nonsuspicious Ss was not supported. However, Ss who were aware that they were being deceived and nevertheless conformed had significantly more positive attitudes on the PRS than aware Ss who conformed less. In addition, Es who tested Ss of the opposite sex biased their results according to their expectations, while for Ss of the same sex the bias was reversed.

"489","Subject effects in laboratory research: An examination of subject roles, demand characteristics, and valid inference","Presents 4 conceptualizations of the role that Ss adopt in laboratory experiments, and assesses empirical support for each. There is no unconfounded evidence that Ss adopt a good S role and seek to confirm hypotheses or that they adopt a negativistic role and seek to sabotage experiments. There is some evidence that in specific contexts Ss may adopt a faithful S role, and there is considerable evidence that Ss are apprehensive about how their performance will be evaluated. Furthermore, providing S with a hypothesis about a study consistently produces bias. These relationships are then examined with respect to their implications for improving research in general and for drawing valid inferences from experimental data. (69 ref.)

In 1 variation, all Ss were made to be angry toward the E's confederate in order to imagine themselves as the movie character who wins the film fight, or as the judge who watches this fighter. Controls were not given any ""image self"" instructions. For the other variation, 1/2 of the Ss were to press a button every time they saw the film aggressor hit his opponent. Deliberately-provoked Ss, identifying with the fight victor, were more aggressive to the confederate then either Ss taking the role of the judge or controls. Within the group identifying with the film aggressor, the more frequently Ss pushed the button (presumably thinking ""hit"" each time), the greater the number of shocks they later gave. Responses to the Nowlis Mood Adjective Check List and another questionnaire suggest that the identification with the film aggressor also engendered hostility toward the experiment and E.

The latter instructions provided a somewhat better approximation to the criterion measure of suspicion derived from detailed coding of the tape-recorded interviews. The extent of a S's suspicion was directly related to his self-esteem, the extent of his training in psychology, and his resistance to influence in the experiment. Also, the behavior of highly suspicious Ss was found to be related to their level of authoritarianism.

"498","Demand characteristics in episodic future thinking II: The role of cues and cue content in changing delay discounting","Episodic future thinking (EFT), or imagining experiencing one’s future, reduces discounting of future rewards, but the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. We examined the role of cues to engage in EFT, possible demand characteristics inherent to those cues (prompting awareness of the hypothesized effects of EFT), and changes in temporal horizon (how far one thinks into the future) in these reductions in delay discounting. In Experiment 1, cues prompting participants to engage in EFT during the discounting task were presented or withheld: EFT decreased discounting only when cues were present. In a time-perspective task in which cues were not presented, EFT did not broaden temporal horizon; however, episodic recent thinking (the putative control activity) shortened temporal horizons. In Experiment 2, cues were manipulated in a way designed to make them either more theoretically relevant (prompting episodic thought) or more prone to demand characteristics (prompting attention to the correspondence in delays between EFT and discounting tasks). Only theoretically relevant cues reduced delay discounting. These results do not support the hypothesis that EFT reduces delay discounting because of demand characteristics. Instead, they suggest limitations on the generalizability of EFT effects in uncued contexts and suggest that mechanisms other than temporal horizon may be responsible for its effects.

Ss were given role conceptions which defined their roles as active or passive and then placed in an experimental situation (Increased Output, Decreased Output/Obsessive-Compulsive, and Control) where they could cooperate or not cooperate with the E. As predicted, passive Ss showed a significantly smaller increase in performance than active Ss in the Increased Output condition, but did not show a significantly smaller decrease in the Decreased Output/Obsessive-Compulsive condition even though the difference was in the predicted direction. Further, among aware Ss there was a significantly greater proportion of active Ss who indicated a willingness to cooperate with the E to support his hypothesis.

Half of the Ss were instructed beforehand that alcohol would increase their degree of sexual arousal in response to the erotic film; the other half were told that alcohol would decrease their sexual arousal. Measures of vaginal pressure pulse obtained by means of a vaginal photoplethysmograph showed a significant negative linear relation with alcohol doses. A significant Sessions * Instructional Set interaction indicated that Ss in the increase-set condition experienced less sexual arousal.

Initially, responding produced timeouts from pressing a force cell on a variable-ratio (VR) schedule, which was then discontinued (extinction). Based on extinction data, participants were distributed into two groups. Participants in the Extinction Group (for which response rates were low in extinction) were instructed that the experimenter expected them to continue responding in extinction after a second exposure to the VR schedule. Participants in the Persistence group (for which response rates were high in extinction) were instructed that the experimenter expected them to stop responding in extinction. Relative to the condition in which instructions were absent, extinction-response rates increased and decreased, respectively, for participants in the Persistence and Extinction groups. These results replicate and extend to negatively reinforced responding previous findings that showed behavioral control by instructions formulated as explicit experimenter demands or expectations.

In the original article, the authors inadvertently omitted a statement declaring the research and subsequent research report to be part of the dissertation of the first author according to the doctoral regulations for obtaining the degree ""Dr. rer. biol. hum.""] Background: While current theories on perception of interoceptive signals suggest impaired interoceptive processing in psychiatric disorders such as panic disorder or depression, heart-rate (HR) interoceptive accuracy (IAc) of panic patients under resting conditions is superior to that of healthy controls. Thus, in this study, we chose to assess further physiological parameters and comorbid depression in order to get information on how these potentially conflicting findings are linked together. Design: We used a quasi-experimental laboratory design which included multi-parametric physiological data collection of 40 panic subjects and 53 matched no-panic controls, as well as experimental induction of stress and relaxation over a time-course. Methods: Stress reactivity, interoceptive awareness (IAw; from the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ)) and IAc (as correlation between self-estimation and physiological data) were major outcome variables. Self-estimation of bioparametrical change was measured via numeric rating scales. Result: Panic subjects had stronger HR-reaction and more accurate HR-interoception. Concurrently, though, their IAc of skin conductance level, pulse amplitude and breathing amplitude was significantly lower than that of the control group. Interestingly, comorbid depression was found to be associated with increased IAw but attenuated IAc. Limitations: Demand characteristics and a categorical approach to panic confine the results. Conclusion: The potentially conflicting findings coalesce, as panic was associated with an increase of the ability to perceive the fear-related parameter and a simultaneous decrease of the ability to perceive other parameters.

In Study 1, 30 never-depressed participants generated 12 positive and 12 negative autobiographical memories. Memories associated with cue–personal word pairings were learned to criterion. Participants were then asked to recall the memory associated with some of the cue–personal word pairs (i.e., think condition) or to avoid saying or thinking about the memory associated with others (i.e., no-think condition). In a subsequent test of recall, systematic forgetting effects emerged for no-think autobiographical memories compared to baseline that received neither no-think nor think instructions. These findings were extended and replicated in a second ATNT study (using a further 30 never-depressed participants), which showed that the forgetting of autobiographical memories in the no-think condition was unlikely to be a function of thought substitution or demand characteristics.

This phenomenon can extend beyond its typical use in pharmaceutical drugs to involve aspects of everyday life, such as the effect of sleep on cognitive functioning. In 2 studies examining whether perceived sleep quality affects cognitive functioning, 164 participants reported their previous night’s sleep quality. They were then randomly assigned to 1 of 2 sleep quality conditions or 2 control conditions. Those in the “above average” sleep quality condition were informed that they had spent 28.7% of their total sleep time in REM, whereas those in the “below average” sleep quality condition were informed that they had only spent 16.2% of their time in REM sleep. Assigned sleep quality but not self-reported sleep quality significantly predicted participants’ scores on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test and Controlled Oral Word Association Task. Assigned sleep quality did not predict participants’ scores on the Digit Span task, as expected, nor did it predict scores on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, which was unexpected. The control conditions showed that the findings were not due to demand characteristics from the experimental protocol. These findings supported the hypothesis that mindset can influence cognitive states in both positive and negative directions, suggesting a means of controlling one’s health and cognition.

"509","fMRI of the brain’s response to stimuli experimentally paired with alcohol intoxication","Rationale: Individuals learn associations between alcohol’s sensory properties and intoxication, with such conditioned stimuli (CS) becoming involved in craving and relapse. However, these CS also carry idiosyncratic associations. Objectives: This study aimed to test brain responses to novel CS conditioned with alcohol intoxication. Methods: Fourteen heavy drinkers (age 24.9 ± 3.2) performed a reaction time task with embedded novel geometric CS and were told only that the task was to measure alcohol’s effect on speed. Rapid intravenous alcohol infusion (the unconditioned stimulus; UCS) began with the appearance of a CS+, using pharmacokinetic modeling to increment breath alcohol by ~18 mg% in 200 s per each of six CS–UCS pairings. Placebo–saline infusion with CS- used the same infusion parameters in same-day randomized/counterbalanced sessions. The next morning subjects, connected to inactive intravenous pumps, underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the same task with mixed brief presentations of CS+, CS-, and irrelevant CS and were told that alcohol could be infused at any time during imaging. Results: CS- responses were significantly greater than those of CS+ in medial frontal cortex. Notably, CS+ responses were negative, suggesting reduced neural activity. Negative activity was most pronounced in early scans, extinguishing with time. As subjects were told that alcohol could be administered in fMRI, a CS+ without alcohol is similar to a negative prediction error, with associated reduced frontal activity during withheld reward. Conclusions: Novel stimuli relatively free of demand characteristics can be classically conditioned to intermittent brain exposure of even low alcohol concentrations, permitting imaging studies of conditioned alcohol expectancies.

In Experiment 1, sixty participants received positive, neutral, or negative information concerning the effect of Mozart's music on intellectual performance, and subsequently completed the Differential Abilities Tests after hearing Mozart, silence, or white noise. No Mozart effect was found, but both spatial and verbal intelligence scores were higher for the participants who had been given neutral instructions rather than either positive or negative expectations. No effect of mood or musical preference was found. In Experiment 2, performance in a physical strength task was again found to be higher with neutral, rather than positive or negative, expectations (N = 60). No effect of Mozart was observed upon strength.

"513","Do demand characteristics contribute to minimal ingroup preferences?","“Minimal group” paradigms investigate social preferences arising from mere group membership. We asked whether demand characteristics contribute to children’s apparent minimal group bias in a preregistered experiment ( N = 160). In a group condition, we attempted to replicate findings of bias following assignment to minimal groups. A second closely matched no-group condition retained potential demand characteristics while removing group assignment. Parallel bias in the no-group condition would suggest that demand characteristics contribute to findings of apparent ingroup bias. Three main findings emerged. First, in the group condition, ingroup preference emerged in one of three bias measures only. Second, this preference emerged even though participants evaluated ingroup/outgroup photos varying in race/ethnicity between trials. Third, the measure that yielded ingroup preferences in the group condition produced no parallel bias in the no-group condition, consistent with the view that mere membership in a group, not experimental demand, leads to minimal ingroup preferences.

"514","Social music: Investigating the link between personal liking and perceived groove","INTEGRATING METHODS FROM EXPERIMENTAL social psychology and music perception, we tested the hypothesis that when listeners personally like a musician, they will be more inclined to experience his or her music as both provoking movement and as subjectively pleasurable, the two core features of perceived groove. In Experiment 1, participants were exposed to a set of moderately-syncopated, high-groove drum-breaks which they were led to believe were either produced by a relatively likable or unlikable musician. In line with predictions, participants led to find the musician more versus less likable rated the same drum-breaks as more evocative of both the urge to move and of feelings of pleasure. When participants in a follow-up study (Experiment 2) were administered the exact same manipulation of likability, but exposed to highly-syncopated, low-groove drum-breaks, these effects were eradicated, suggesting that the results of Experiment 1 were not merely due to demand characteristics or response biases. Together, these findings support the notion that listeners are more responsive to ‘‘participating in the music’’ when they are relatively motivated to affiliate with the musician(s). Methodological limitations and directions for future research on the social psychological underpinnings of groove are discussed.

"515","Does grasping capacity influence object size estimates? It depends on the context","Linkenauger, Witt, and Proffitt ( Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 37 (5), 1432–1441, 2011, Experiment 2) reported that right-handers estimated objects as smaller if they intended to grasp them in their right rather than their left hand. Based on the action-specific account, they argued that this scaling effect occurred because participants believed their right hand could grasp larger objects. However, Collier and Lawson ( Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 43 (4), 749–769, 2017) failed to replicate this effect. Here, we investigated whether this discrepancy in results arose from demand characteristics. We investigated two forms of demand characteristics: altering responses following conscious hypothesis guessing (Experiments 1 and 2), and subtle influences of the experimental context (Experiment 3). We found no scaling effects when participants were given instructions which implied the expected outcome of the experiment (Experiment 1), but they were obtained when we used unrealistically explicit instructions which gave the exact prediction made by the action-specific account (Experiment 2). Scaling effects were also found using a context in which grasping capacity could seem relevant for size estimation (by asking participants about the perceived graspability of an object immediately before asking about its size on every trial, as was done in Linkenauger et al., 2011; Experiment 2). These results suggest that demand characteristics due to context effects could explain the scaling effects reported in Experiment 2 of Linkenauger et al. (2011), rather than either hypothesis guessing, or, as proposed by the action-specific account, a change in the perceived size of objects.

In this paper, we tested whether having strategic options (vs. not) is helpful or harmful for regulating negative emotions. In 5 studies (N = 151) participants were presented with 1 or more strategic options prior to watching aversive images and using the selected strategic option. Across studies, we found that people reported less intense negative emotions when the strategy they used to regulate their emotions was presented as a single option, rather than as 1 of several options. This was regardless of whether people could choose between the options (Studies 3–5) or not (Studies 1, 2, and 4), and specific to negative (but not neutral) images (Study 5). A sixth study addressed an explanation based on demand characteristics, showing that participants expected to feel more positive when having more than 1 option. The findings indicate that having strategic options for regulating negative emotions can sometimes be costly.

"517","The effect of heightened awareness of observation on consumption of a multi-item laboratory test meal in females","Human eating behaviour is often studied in the laboratory, but whether the extent to which a participant believes that their food intake is being measured influences consumption of different meal items is unclear. Our main objective was to examine whether heightened awareness of observation of food intake affects consumption of different food items during a lunchtime meal. One hundred and fourteen female participants were randomly assigned to an experimental condition designed to heighten participant awareness of observation or a condition in which awareness of observation was lower, before consuming an ad libitum multi-item lunchtime meal in a single session study. Under conditions of heightened awareness, participants tended to eat less of an energy dense snack food (cookies) in comparison to the less aware condition. Consumption of other meal items and total energy intake were similar in the heightened awareness vs. less aware condition. Exploratory secondary analyses suggested that the effect heightened awareness had on reduced cookie consumption was dependent on weight status, as well as trait measures of dietary restraint and disinhibition, whereby only participants with overweight/obesity, high disinhibition or low restraint reduced their cookie consumption. Heightened awareness of observation may cause females to reduce their consumption of an energy dense snack food during a test meal in the laboratory and this effect may be moderated by participant individual differences.

"518","Perceiving time differences when you should not: Applying the El Greco fallacy to hypnotic time distortions","The way we experience and estimate time—subjective time—does not systematically correspond to objective time (the physical duration of an event). Many factors can influence subjective time and lead to mental dilation or compression of objective time. The emotional valence of stimuli or the levels of attention or expectancy are known to modulate subjective time even though objective time is constant. Hypnosis too is known to alter people’s perception of time. However, it is not known whether hypnotic time distortions are intrinsic perceptual effects, based for example on the changing rate of an internal clock, or rather the result of a response to demand characteristics. Here we distinguished the theories using the logic of the El Greco fallacy. When participants initially had to compare the duration of two successive events—with the same duration—while in “trance,” they responded that the second event was on average longer than the first event. As both events were estimated in “trance,” if hypnosis had impacted on an internal clock, they should have been affected to the same extent. Conversely, when only the first event was in “trance,” there was no difference in perceived duration. The findings conform to an El Greco fallacy effect and challenge theories of hypnotic time distortion arguing that “trance” itself changes subjective time.

Awareness that food consumption is being monitored is a demand characteristic in eating-behaviour experiments","Eating behaviour is often studied in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Yet people care about the impressions others form about them so may behave differently if they feel that their eating behaviour is being monitored. Here we examined whether participants are likely to change their eating behaviour if they feel that food intake is being monitored during a laboratory study. In Study 1 participants were provided with vignettes of typical eating behaviour experiments and were asked if, and how, they would behave differently if they felt their eating behaviour was being monitored during that experiment. Study 2 tested the effect of experimentally manipulating participants’ beliefs about their eating behaviour being monitored on their food consumption in the lab. In Study 1, participants thought they would change their behaviour if they believed their eating was being monitored and, if monitored, that they would reduce their food consumption. In Study 2 participants ate significantly less food after being led to believe that their food consumption was being recorded. Together, these studies demonstrate that if participants believe that the amount of food they eat during a study is being monitored then they are likely to suppress their food intake. This may impact the conclusions that are drawn from food intake studies.

"520","Paired preference tests with reversed hidden demand characteristics","To gain insight into the proportion of consumers who respond to extraneous factors in the paired preference testing situation, rather than the sensory properties of products being assessed, “placebo” preference tests with putatively identical products are used. One use is as a tool to select consumers who ignore extraneous factors and are thus suitable for use in preference tests, where experimenters wish to have confidence that consumers are ignoring extraneous factors and responding only to the sensory attributes of the products being tested. Yet, selecting such consumers tends often to reduce the sample size to approximately 20–35% of its original, which is unacceptably low. The protocol used in this study employed unusual instructions and questions to reverse the hidden demand characteristics of the test, so that the sample size was only reduced to 80–90% of its original. Practical Applications Paired preference tests are part of the battery of tests used for measuring food acceptance. Although, when used casually, the test is simple; when used for a formal assessment of acceptance, there are problems that must be addressed. One such problem is the tendency of consumers to respond with preferences, even when the stimuli are putatively identical. Such a bias has the potential to produce an overestimation of preferences, when products are being assessed by paired preference protocols. Accordingly, research into this phenomenon is worthwhile, so that more valid and reliable tests can be developed.

Clients completed the SRS for the first three sessions of treatment. Results: No statistically significant differences in SRS scores across the feedback conditions were found. Additionally, the analysis showed that SRS scores were not correlated with a measure of social desirability but were correlated with an established alliance measure. Conclusions: The results indicate that alliance scores were not inflated due to the presence of a therapist or knowing that the scores would be observed by the therapist.

Although this methodology may indeed facilitate the retrieval process by conducting the test in a manner resembling ordinary dialogue, the methodology might also unintentionally put further demand characteristics on the respondents. In the present study we systematically manipulated the target age (either 3 or 6 years of age) for the warm-up question preceding the ‘earliest memory’ question in order to test this possibility. The participants were 445 Danish high school students ( M age = 17.94). The results revealed that systematically manipulating the target age for the warm-up question had a strong impact on the age of the earliest memory reported by the adolescents. Participants who received warm-up questions with 3 years as the target age subsequently reported earlier first memories than the participants receiving warm-up questions with 6 years as the target age. These results have important implications for the methodology involved in research on childhood amnesia.

"524","Evaluating the mind’s eye: The metacognition of visual imagery","Can people evaluate phenomenal qualities of internally generated experiences, such as whether a mental image is vivid or detailed? This question exemplifies a problem of metacognition: How well do people know their own thoughts? In the study reported here, participants were instructed to imagine a specific visual pattern and rate its vividness, after which they were presented with an ambiguous rivalry display that consisted of the previously imagined pattern plus an orthogonal pattern. On individual trials, higher ratings of vividness predicted a greater likelihood that the imagined pattern would appear dominant when the participant was subsequently presented with the binocular rivalry display. Off-line self-report questionnaires measuring imagery vividness also predicted individual differences in the strength of imagery bias over the entire study. Perceptual bias due to mental imagery could not be attributed to demand characteristics, as no bias was observed on catch-trial presentations of mock rivalry displays. Our findings provide novel evidence that people have a good metacognitive understanding of their own mental imagery and can reliably evaluate the vividness of single episodes of imagination.

"525","Helping children correctly say “I don't know” to unanswerable questions","Adults ask children questions in a variety of contexts, for example, in the classroom, in the forensic context, or in experimental research. In such situations children will inevitably be asked some questions to which they do not know the answer, because they do not have the required information (“unanswerable” questions). When asked unanswerable questions, it is important that children indicate that they do not have the required information to provide an answer. These 2 studies investigated whether preinterview instructions (Experiment 1) or establishing a memory narrative (Experiment 2) helped children correctly indicate a lack of knowledge to unanswerable questions. In both studies, 6- and 8-year-olds participated in a classroom-based event about which they were subsequently interviewed. Some of the questions were answerable, and some were unanswerable. Results showed that preinterview instructions increased the number of younger children's appropriate “don't know” responses to unanswerable questions, without decreasing correct responses to answerable questions. This suggests that demand characteristics affect children's tendency correctly to say “I don't know.” The opportunity to provide a narrative account increased children's appropriate “don't know” responses to unanswerable yes/no questions, and increased the number of younger children's correct responses to answerable questions. This suggests that cognitive factors also contribute to children's tendency correctly to say “I don't know.” These results have implications for any context where adults need to obtain information from children through questioning, for example, a health practitioner asking about a medical condition, in classroom discourse, in the investigative interview, and in developmental psychology research.

"526","Objective and subjective measures indicate that orthographically similar words produce a blocking experience","Memory blocks are a common experience characterised by inappropriate retrieval of information that impairs memory search processes. In five studies, memory blocks were induced via exposure to orthographically similar words (Smith &amp; Tindell, 1997) while participants reported their subjective experiences to determine whether the memory block effect (MBE) paradigm produces a feeling of being blocked. Experiments 1 and 3 provided evidence that the MBE is associated with more blocked experiences. In Experiments 2 and 4 increased blocking experiences correlated with blocked fragments when the experimental manipulation was disguised, which demonstrates that ratings were not contaminated by demand characteristics. Experiment 5 demonstrated that blocking happens even when there is no study list. Collectively, the subjective retrieval ratings and the objective response data provide converging evidence that exposure to orthographically similar words induces a memory block characterised by an ineffective memory search that perseverates on interfering information.

"527","In defence of situational morality: Genetic, dispositional and situational determinants of children's donating to charity","In this paper we argue that moral behavior is largely situation-specific. Genetic make-up, neurobiological factors, attachment security and rearing experiences have only limited influence on individual differences in moral performance. Moral behavior does not develop in a linear and cumulative fashion and individual morality is not stable across time and situations. To illustrate our position we present two studies on children's willingness to donate their money to a charity (UNICEF) as a prime example of pro-social behavior. In two samples of seven-year-old children we found no evidence for a role of attachment, temperament or parenting. Using a twin design we did not find any evidence for a genetic component either. The most striking finding in both studies was that very few children were inclined to donate any money after viewing a promotional UNICEF film about children suffering from poverty. Only after gentle probing by an experimenter were most children willing to donate some of their money. The situation appeared to be a much more powerful determinant of donating behavior than any other factor. These findings are discussed in the broader context of evidence for situational canalization of moral behavior. We conclude that moral competence may be a universal human characteristic, but that it takes a situation with specific demand-characteristics to translate this competence into actual prosocial performance.

"528","Who is being deceived? The experimental demands of wearing a backpack","A growing literature argues that wearing a heavy backpack makes slopes look steeper and distances seem longer (e.g., Proffitt, 2006). To test for effects of experimental demand characteristics in a backpack experiment, we manipulated the experimental demand of the backpack and then used a postexperiment questionnaire to assess participants’ beliefs about the purpose of the backpack. For participants in the low-demand condition, an elaborate deception was used to provide an alternative explanation of the requirement to wear a heavy backpack (i.e., that it held EMG equipment). The highest slope judgments were found for those undeceived participants who guessed that the backpack was intended to affect their slope perception and also reported that they thought they were affected by it. When persuaded that the backpack served another purpose, participants’ slope estimates were no different from those of participants not wearing a backpack. These findings suggest that backpack effects, and other reported effects of effort on perception, are judgmental biases that result from the social, not physical, demands of the experimental context.

Otherwise healthy undergraduates (N = 20) were exposed to a cold pressor task before, immediately after, and 10 min following one of the two interventions. Half of the participants also were assigned to a high demand characteristic condition in which the experimenter maintained close physical proximity, eye contact, and placed subtle social pressure on participants to please the experimenter. The results showed that the most important factor influencing latency to withstand the cold pressor task was social pressure. The acceptance-based intervention was more subject to demand than the control strategy. Evaluative ratings of pain were unaffected by the demand manipulation. The current data suggest that demand characteristics can exert a significant positive impact on the outcome of therapeutic protocols. The implications of this view for acceptance- and control-based psychosocial interventions are discussed.

"534","Experimental effects of priming on affective responses to acute exercise","Objective: The purpose of this study was to experimentally investigate the relationship between positive affect elicitation (using a short video clip) prior to exercise and affect during acute aerobic exercise. Methods: We conducted three related experiments. In Experiment 1, 30 subjects participated in a positive affect-elicitation condition (""affective priming"") and a control condition. Participation involved watching a five-minute video clip, as well as walking on a treadmill at a (self-selected) brisk pace for ten minutes. We compared affective ratings at baseline and intra-exercise for both conditions using a 2 (condition; priming versus no priming) x 2 (time; pre- versus mid-exercise) repeated measures ANOVA. In the follow-up experiments, we re-examined the relationship between affective priming and intra-exercise affect, addressing some limitations noted with Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, we compared the affect-elicitation properties of self-selected and imposed video clips. In Experiment 3, we re-investigated the potential affective benefit of priming, while including a neutral video during the control condition to attenuate potential demand characteristics, and a positive video-only condition to investigate possible carryover effects. Results: Self-selected and imposed film clips showed similar affect-elicitation properties. Comparing the priming and control conditions, there were notable differences in the mean intra-exercise affective valence ratings (P = 0.07 Experiment 1, P = 0.01 Experiment 3). The mean affective activation ratings were not significantly different (P = 0.07 Experiment 1, P = 0.86 Experiment 3). Conclusion: Priming the affective state prior to exercise may be beneficial for enhancing intra-exercise affect.

"535","Separating responses based on demand characteristics and phenomenological–spatial associations","Previous researchers have found that participants associate higher frequencies with locations that are higher in space and lower frequencies with lower locations, creating a phenomenological–spatial association for the frequency of auditory tones. With such an association, the frequency of an auditory tone could potentially bias movements along multiple axes. This hypothesis was tested. In four experiments, nine frequencies (250–1,250 Hz) were binaurally presented to blindfolded participants ( n = 10, 12, 20, &amp; 9; M age = 22 yr.) who indicated the perceived location of the stimuli on a measurement scale oriented in the vertical, the horizontal (Experiment 1), or depth dimension (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, participants were asked to indicate the perceived location of the frequencies on a two-dimensional vertical board located in front of them. In Experiment 4, participants indicated the perceived location in three-dimensional space. An optoelectronic device recorded at all locations. Analyses of constant error indicated a spatial association in the vertical, horizontal, and depth dimensions when responses were restricted to only one dimension (Experiments 1 &amp; 2). Higher frequencies were perceived to be located higher, farther to the right, and farther away from the body than lower frequencies. However, this spatial association was only exhibited in the vertical dimension when the responses were unconstrained in two dimensions (vertical and horizontal; Experiment 3) and all three dimensions (Experiment 4). Although this spatial association is a robust phenomenon, it appears that the association only biases actions when indicating perceived locations in the vertical dimension during unconstrained responses.

"536","Evaluating preschoolers' comprehension of educational television: The role of viewer characteristics, stimuli features, and contextual expectations","This study represents the first experimental investigation to simultaneously evaluate the impact of three key areas of a child’s television viewing experience—individual differences (story schema), the stimulus (narrative type), and the environment (perceived demand characteristics). Guided by the capacity model (Fisch, 2000, 2004), preschoolers’ comprehension of an educational television program was evaluated in a 2 (story schema: low, high) x 2 (perceived demand characteristics: fun (low), learning (high)) x 2 (narrative type: participatory cues absent, participatory cues present) between-subjects fully crossed factorial experiment. Comprehension was operationalized as both narrative (i.e. central, incidental, and inferential comprehension) and educational content comprehension. A total of 172 preschoolers (102 females) participated in the study (Mean Age = 4.2 years). Children were randomly assigned to one of four conditions created by crossing the perceived demand characteristic manipulation with the narrative type manipulation. Story schema level was assigned through a median-split procedure based on story schema scores. In addition to program comprehension, data was collected on expressive vocabulary, story schema skills, program familiarity, and engagement with and attention to stimuli. Advanced story schema supported narrative comprehension, and this reduction in narrative processing demands translated to educational content comprehension. Children’s television programmers are advised to design educational television content which conforms to a prototypical story structure while integrating educational content within the narrative. Additionally, while children seemed able to devote greater attention to content when asked to “watch to learn”, they appeared to struggle with how to differentially distribute this attention, resulting in minimally enhanced inferential processing and no additional benefits to educational content comprehension. Finally, the inclusion of participatory cues in children’s television programming was not sufficient to support comprehension. Rather, it seems that engagement with participatory cues is necessary to support comprehension—particularly for children with low story schema and children viewing “for fun”. When integrating the findings for perceived demand characteristics and narrative type, children’s television programmers are advised to use participatory cues strategically to highlight educational content.

"537","Semantic priming: On the role of awareness in visual word recognition in the absence of an expectancy","By hypothesis, awareness is involved in the modulation of feedback from semantics to the lexical level in the visual word recognition system. When subjects are aware of the fact that there are many related prime-target pairs in a semantic priming experiment, this knowledge is used to configure the system to feed activation back from semantics to the lexical level so as to facilitate processing. When subjects are unaware of this fact, the default set is maintained in which activation is not fed back from semantics to the lexical level so as to conserve limited resources. Qualitative differences in the pattern of data from 2 lexical decision experiments that employ masked priming are consistent with this hypothesis. Semantic context and stimulus quality interact when the prime is processed with awareness whereas these same 2 factors produce additive effects on reaction time when the prime is unlikely to have been processed with awareness. These experiments thus illustrate 1 way in which awareness (or lack thereof) affects the dynamics of visual word recognition.

"538","The role of monitoring in the activation of mental concepts","Four experiments are reported to address the theory that monitoring for a target word increases activation of that target. Previous research has found some evidence for this proposition, but has been compromised by demand characteristics. To avoid this, the present study depended upon the weak demand characteristics of the lexical decision task and the expectancy effect. It was found that priming due to monitoring in the lexical decision task was (1) not affected by stimulus onset asynchrony; (2) could be voluntarily increased by participants, and (3) was reduced by mental load. Additionally, it was found that (4) instructions not to prime were effective until mental load was introduced. Wegner's theory of ironic processes holds that the process of monitoring could be responsible for the difficulty some people report with the suppression of unwanted thoughts. His theory was supported in that monitoring for target words activated those words but the automaticity of that process was brought into question by evidence for some strategic control.

"539","Computerized content analysis: A comparison of the verbal productions of high-hypnotizable, low-hypnotizable and simulating subjects","This research was designed to investigate the domain of hypnosis and to explore how the ""state"" of hypnosis, along with the susceptibility to hypnosis relate to lexical choice in verbal productions as well as to primary/secondary process mentation. The hypothesis that hypnosis facilitates primary process mentation has held a central place in numerous psychoanalytically oriented theories of hypnosis. College students were screened for hypnotic susceptibility employing: The Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility, Form A (HGSHS: A) and The Computer-Assisted Hypnosis Scale (CAH). A total of 89 subjects were identified: Three groups were obtained: 32 high hypnotizable subjects, 29 low hypnotizable subjects and 28 low hypnotizable simulating subjects. Responses to Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) cards and responses to free speech story-openings were collected and tape-recorded during both the waking state and the ""state"" of hypnosis. All tape-recordings of verbal productions were transcribed and analyzed by two computer content analysis programs: The Dartmouth Adaptation of The General Inquirer/Harvard III Psycho-Sociological Dictionary (DAGI-III) which analyzes a text for 105 lexical choice variables and COUNT/Regressive Imagery Dictionary (COUNT-RID) which analyzes a text for 99 categories, among other variables, for level of primary and secondary process mentation. Findings suggest that the changes in SECONDARY PROCESS and THOUGHT, as well as the DAGI-III-variable EMOTION and the COUNT-RID-variable EMOTION, may be a result other than hypnotic ability or the hypnotic experience. The possibility has been raised, that subjects who had been instructed to simulate hypnosis were successful in discerning the experimental, implicit demands to respond with decreased SECONDARY PROCESS and THOUGHT as measured by the DAGI-III and COUNT-RID respectively and to present the appearance of a genuinely hypnotized subject. The same was true for the increase in EMOTION as measured by the DAGI-III as well as by the COUNT-RID. The likelihood that the hypnotic main-effect can be attributed at least to some extent to demand characteristics has been supported by the current results. The hypnotic ""state"", even though it can be measured through behavioral measures such as the HGSHS and the CAH, cannot be measured by content measures of verbal productions.

"541","The dream hidden observer in the context of hypnosis and alert imagination at Ohio University","The term ""dream hidden observer"" designates the behaviors and subjective experiences of individuals in response to a suggestion for a hidden observer, following a suggestion for a dream. The latest in a series of studies designed to examine the dream hidden observer phenomenon, the present research tested three hypotheses. The first hypothesis, derived from the sociocognitive theory of hypnosis, was that hidden observer reports were sensitive to demand characteristics. The second and third hypotheses, derived from the psychoanalytic theory of hypnosis, were that hypnosis was characterized by a preponderance of primary process mentation and that hypnosis facilitated the availability of affect. Forty high hypnotizable individuals were randomly assigned to a hypnosis or to an alert imagination group. After being asked to report a dream, the participants were informed that there was a hidden part of them, which was always aware of things they might otherwise not notice and were asked to give a hidden observer report. Finally, they were asked to recall in writing their dream and hidden observer narratives and to complete questionnaires regarding their experiences during the experiment. Two raters rated independently the content of the dream and hidden observer narratives on the following measures: completeness of recall, blending, primary process thinking, primary process mechanisms, primitivity of expression of impulses, anxiety and hostility. The renditions of participants' subjective experiences of the hidden observer phenomenon were also examined. The present findings provided support for the hypothesis that hidden observer narratives were sensitive to demand characteristics, and only qualified support to the hypothesis that hypnosis (i.e., specific hypnotic tasks) was conducive to a preponderance of primary process mentation in high hypnotizable individuals.

Five different groups were assembled, which received either a happy or a sad mood induction, a happy or a sad simulation instruction or a neutral instruction (control group). Instruction effects were measured on a task in which all subjects had to judge drawings of ambiguous facial expressions. Mood effects could be demonstrated for younger (n=152, mean age 6;11) as well as older children (n=151, mean age 10;9), but only for good imagers, not for bad ones. Judgements of happy and sad children were biased in a direction congruent to the induced mood state. This mood congruity effect was not the result of demand characteristics as it did not show up in both simulation groups (i.e. children who were simply ""acting as if they were happy or sad"").

Experimental Ss were exposed to 1 of 4 appeals reflecting the different levels of moral development, and their donating behavior was contrasted with that of control Ss who were exposed to repeated presentations of the highest level (altruistic) cue. Findings show that older Ss were more likely to donate in response to both higher level moral appeals and to repeated presentations of the altruistic cue. Grade and moral level of the appeal interacted to affect the amount donated, with older Ss donating significantly more in response to higher level appeals. The necessity of incorporating both qualitative and quantitative dimensions in general models of the development of prosocial behavior is discussed.

Nine healthy women (aged 20–27 yrs) with regular menstrual cycles were randomly assigned to a group told that menstrual cycle symptomatology was the focus of the study, and 9 healthy women (aged 19–34 yrs) with regular menstrual cycles were assigned to a group to which no interest in menstrual cycle symptoms was communicated. Nine males (aged 20–30 yrs) were also included as a control group.

Each week for 8 wks, Ss' heart rate, body weight, and body temperature were measured, and Ss completed choice RT and time estimation tasks. Results show that Ss who were informed of the interest in menstrual cycle symptomatology reported significantly more negative psychological and somatic symptoms at the premenstrual and menstrual phases than did the women and men not so informed.

Judgments of the intensity of feeling when the events occurred were inversely related to report latency. Results support the conclusion that intensity ratings were reliable indices of memory information rather than inferences or reconstructions mediated by report latency. Findings are discussed in terms of an extent-of-processing hypothesis and related to a more general theory of memory processes.

Male undergraduates were put into a buzzer-shock-finger withdrawal situation and then given Rotter's Internal-External (I-E) scale. All Ss were told that they would receive a shock. Half of them were also instructed to avoid it. Significantly fewer of the uninstructed group learned the avoidance response. Of the instructed group, those Ss who acquired the response had higher I-E scores. External Ss made proportionately fewer CRs during acquisition and required more trials to extinction than the Internal Ss.

"555","Moral essentialism and generosity among children and adults","Children and adults view many characteristics in an essentialist way—as innate, immutable, and biological. Prior work has typically investigated essentialism regarding broad domains (e.g., gender rather than maleness/femaleness). Using the example of morality, the current work asked whether individuals view different components of 1 domain (goodness/badness) differently and whether such views might influence behavior. Five- to 8-year-olds reported more essentialism than adults; however, both children and adults viewed goodness in more essentialist terms than badness. Although views of morally relevant characteristics in general did not significantly predict generosity (Study 1), essentialist views of the recipient did influence generosity (Studies 2 and 3). Adults shared fewer resources than would be expected by chance with people whose badness was described in essentialist terms (and consequently more resources than would be expected by chance with people whose badness was described in nonessentialist terms), an effect that did not appear to be driven by demand characteristics and that persisted even when both descriptions explicitly noted that the character would always remain bad. Although adults reported less essentialism than children, essentialist descriptions appeared to influence their behaviors more. This work highlights the need to investigate essentialism regarding specific domain components (e.g., goodness/badness) in addition to the domain overall (e.g., morality), partially because essentialism impacts behavior differently across components. Findings also suggest that emphasizing situational factors contributing to wrongdoing and a transgressor’s ability to change may benefit people when they have committed moral violations.

"556","Manipulation of expended effort and intent does not affect estimates of slant or distance","It is well known that people overestimate the orientation of both geographical and man-made sloped surfaces by between 5°–20°. More recently, work has shown that when people are encumbered by wearing a heavy backpack they overestimate hills and distances even more than a group not wearing heavy backpacks; however, the backpack manipulation has since been shown to be a demand effect—that is, being encumbered does not affect perception—it only biases those people influenced by it to give estimates the experimenters are seeking. Here we first show that expended effort and intent have never actually been manipulated between subjects in any of the work on steepness estimates, and expended effort has never been explicitly manipulated between subjects for distance estimates. When they are, they do not affect steepness or distance estimates. Our work is the first to experimentally manipulate effort and intent, to do this between subjects, while controlling for demand characteristics and checking to see whether the effort manipulation was effective. The experimental manipulation of effort and especially intent may be of benefit to parsing out perceptual effects from more cognitive or postperceptual processes in future work.

"557","Microworkers as research participants: Does underpaying Turkers lead to cognitive dissonance?","Social science researchers increasingly rely on microworkers to serve as study participants, paying them very little compared to participants recruited from other venues. This has raised ethical concerns and questioned the validity of research based on microworkers. Informed by cognitive dissonance theory, we conducted two between-subjects experiments to examine the effects of underpaying Amazon Mechanical Turk workers (Turkers) on their perceptions and their actual performance on criteria crucial to online social science research. Data show that underpaid Turkers experienced ‘cognitive dissonance’ such that those paid as low as $0.25 rated their participation as more important than those who were paid higher. Perceived importance was associated with other positive perceptions and demand characteristics. Nevertheless, underpaying Turkers increased dropout rate, reduced their level of effort in answering open-ended questions and undermined perceived agency. We discuss the ethical and practical implications of underpaying microworkers.

However, are mindwanders also more likely to generate incorrect associations based on what they have read? This question is especially critical for science learning, as errors in understanding can resonate through future learning efforts. Across 2 experiments, participants read a science text and were asked to generate a causal essay response related to the text, in addition to completing a sentence recognition test. Participants who reported more mindwandering not only demonstrated lower levels of correct understanding overall, but also included more misunderstandings in their essay responses. Mediational analyses suggest that the production of misunderstandings was tied to less available correct knowledge, and not demand characteristics at time of test. The results from these experiments suggest that mindwandering does not just prohibit correct memory for text, but also produces a negative learning effect in the form of textual misunderstanding.

"559","Thought probes during prospective memory encoding: Evidence for perfunctory processes","For nearly 50 years, psychologists have studied prospective memory, or the ability to execute delayed intentions. Yet, there remains a gap in understanding as to whether initial encoding of the intention must be elaborative and strategic, or whether some components of successful encoding can occur in a perfunctory, transient manner. In eight studies (N = 680), we instructed participants to remember to press the Q key if they saw words representing fruits (cue) during an ongoing lexical decision task. They then typed what they were thinking and responded whether they encoded fruits as a general category, as specific exemplars, or hardly thought about it at all. Consistent with the perfunctory view, participants often reported mind wandering (42.9%) and hardly thinking about the prospective memory task (22.5%). Even though participants were given a general category cue, many participants generated specific category exemplars (34.5%). Bayesian analyses of encoding durations indicated that specific exemplars came to mind in a perfunctory manner rather than via strategic, elaborative mechanisms. Few participants correctly guessed the research hypotheses and changing from fruit category cues to initial-letter cues eliminated reports of specific exemplar generation, thereby arguing against demand characteristics in the thought probe procedure. In a final experiment, encoding duration was unrelated to prospective memory performance; however, specific-exemplar encoders outperformed general-category encoders with no ongoing task monitoring costs. Our findings reveal substantial variability in intention encoding, and demonstrate that some components of prospective memory encoding can be done ªin passing.º (PsycInfo (2022) Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)","N/A","N/A","0","4",NA,"Scullin, Michael K.;McDaniel, Mark A.;Dasse, Michelle N.;Lee, Ji hae;Kurinec, Courtney A.;Tami, Claudina;Krueger, Madison L.","2018","https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/thought-probes-during-prospective-memory-encoding/docview/2167956849/se-2","APA PsycInfo (2022)"
"560","Simultaneous utilization of multiple cues in judgments of learning","There is much evidence that metacognitive judgments, such as people’s predictions of their future memory performance (judgments of learning, JOLs), are inferences based on cues and heuristics. However, relatively little is known about whether and when people integrate multiple cues in one metacognitive judgment or focus on a single cue without integrating further information. The current set of experiments systematically addressed whether and to what degree people integrate multiple extrinsic and intrinsic cues in JOLs. Experiment 1 varied two cues: number of study presentations (1 vs. 2) and font size (18 point vs. 48 point). Results revealed that people integrated both cues in their JOLs. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the two word characteristics concreteness (abstract vs. concrete) and emotionality (neutral vs. emotional) were integrated in JOLs. Experiment 3 showed that people integrated all four cues in their JOLs when manipulated simultaneously. Finally, Experiment 4 confirmed integration of three cues that varied on a continuum rather than in two easily distinguishable levels. These results demonstrate that people have a remarkable capacity to integrate multiple cues in metacognitive judgments. In addition, our findings render an explanation of cue effects on JOLs in terms of demand characteristics implausible.

"561","Episodic future thinking reduces delay discounting and cigarette demand: An investigation of the good-subject effect","Episodic future thinking (EFT), an intervention involving mental simulation of future events, has been shown to reduce both delay discounting and cigarette self-administration. In the present study, we extended these findings by showing that EFT in a web-based sample of smokers reduces delay discounting and intensity of demand for cigarettes (ad libitum consumption) in a hypothetical purchase task. No effect was observed on elasticity of demand (sensitivity to price) or cigarette craving. We also explored whether demand characteristics (specifically, the “good-subject” effect) might be responsible for observed effects. EFT participants were significantly better able than control participants to discern the experimental hypothesis. However, EFT participants were not better than controls at identifying whether they had been assigned to the experimental group and, likewise, showed no differences in attitudes about the experiment and experimenter. Importantly, effects of EFT on delay discounting and demand remained significant even when controlling for measures of demand characteristics, indicating that EFT’s effects are independent of participants’ perceptions about the experiment.

"562","Demand characteristics in episodic future thinking: Delay discounting and healthy eating","Steep delay discounting, or rapid devaluation of future outcomes, is one mechanism that can account for the chronic selection of smaller-sooner over larger-later outcomes; that is, impulsive choice. Because steep delay discounting is correlated with maladaptive behavior, researchers have explored methods for reducing discounting. One empirically supported method is episodic future thinking (EFT), or vividly imagining one’s future before completing the discounting task. However, EFT procedures may include demand characteristics, which could account for some its beneficial effects. In two experiments, demand characteristics were evaluated by having participants read a description of the interactions between a fictional experimenter and a human subject in a typical EFT study. When subsequently asked to indicate what the fictional experimenter expected the human subject to do after the EFT exercise, participants correctly deduced the experimenter’s hypotheses: that EFT would reduce impulsive choice (Experiment 1A) and consumption of junk food (Experiment 1B). Future research should evaluate and control for the possibility that demand characteristics are at least partially responsible for the beneficial effects of EFT.

"563","Evaluation of a surfing programme designed to increase personal well-being and connectedness to the natural environment among ‘at risk’ young people","Outdoor activities can be an important complement to classroom learning, especially for children/young people excluded, or at risk of exclusion, from mainstream schooling. The current research explored the impact of a 12-week surfing programme among such a group in the UK. Pre-post data on physiological health (heart rate (HR)/blood pressure), self-reported well-being (life and domain satisfaction), connectedness (e.g. to nature, school), environmental awareness (e.g. role of sand dunes) and teacher evaluations (e.g. behaviour) were collected. Results found significant drops in HR (suggesting improved fitness), increased satisfaction with appearance, more positive attitudes towards school and friendships, greater environmental awareness and more positive teacher evaluations, post-intervention. A lack of findings in other domains suggests these results were not due to participants simply conforming to demand characteristics. Overall, the results suggest that surfing interventions could have important benefits for vulnerable young people who struggle with mainstream schooling.

Yet, evidence for such basic cognitive differences is inconsistent, many studies are based on small samples, and few have been replicated. We report a preregistered replication of three prominent findings of cultural differences in visual cognition, testing a substantially larger sample than the original studies. Our comparisons of American and Asian International students living in the United States provided relatively little evidence for robust and consistent cultural differences in global/local biases, relative and absolute length judgments, or change detection performance. Although we observed some differences in change detection performance when comparing Chinese to American students, those differences were inconsistent across measures.

"565","Reducing child-related negative attitudes, attributions of hostile intent, anger, harsh parenting behaviors, and punishment through evaluative conditioning","Six studies explored the extent to which evaluative conditioning (EC) can change adults’ child-related attitudes and expectations. A subset of studies also investigated the extent to which EC can change child-related attributions of hostile intent, anger, use of harsh discipline, and use of punishment. An initial study demonstrated that a brief EC procedure increased positive attitudes, decreased negative attitudes, and decreased expected need for future child discipline; findings that were replicated in five additional studies. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated these findings were present in the EC condition, but not in a control condition. Increases in positive child attitudes and decreases in the expected need for future child discipline (but not decreases in negative child attitudes) were maintained at a follow-up assessment. EC increases in positive attitudes generalized to child stimuli similar to those used in the EC procedure (exemplars), but no other EC-induced changes were found for exemplars. EC reduced child-related attributions of hostile intent, anger, use of harsh verbal discipline, use of harsh physical discipline, and use of punishment for ambiguous child behaviors. There was no evidence that EC effects were due to demand characteristics and little evidence that EC effects were moderated by demographic characteristics. It is yet to be determined whether the observed EC changes can be produced when a parent’s own child is used in the EC procedure and whether EC can produce changes in negative parenting behaviors that are maintained across time. The possible use of EC as an adjunct to existing parenting programs is discussed.

"566","Contrasting the nature and effects of environmentally specific and general transformational leadership","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report findings from two studies that compare the nature (construct validity) and relative effects (incremental predictive validity) of environmentally specific transformational leadership (ETFL) to general transformational leadership. Design/methodology/approach: The nature of ETFL was investigated in an empirical study based on a sample of 185 employees. The relative effects of ETFL were examined in an experimental study based on a sample of 155 university students. Findings: A confirmatory factor analysis showed that environmentally specific and general transformational leadership are empirically distinct but related. Findings from the experimental study revealed that compared to general transformational leadership and a control condition, participants exposed to ETFL he confederate leader’s environmental values and priorities more highly and engaged in higher levels of pro-environmental behaviors. Research limitations/implications: Questions concerning ecological and external validity arise out of the experimental study. Future research should contrast the relative effects of environmentally specific and general transformational leadership across various organizational and cultural conditions. Limitations associated with demand characteristics are also of concern in the experimental study. Future research should include an environmental focus in the control condition to exclude any possible threats related to demand characteristics. Practical implications: Results from these two studies provide useful information regarding within-organization environmental leadership training by suggesting that maximal individual and organizational environmental change may best be achieved by training leaders to be as specific as possible regarding their values, priorities and goals. Social implications: This research suggests that leaders should engage in ETFL behaviors to have the greatest positive impact on corporate environmental sustainability, and by extension, climate change. Originality/value: In two separate studies, the construct and incremental predictive validity of ETFL were assessed.

"567","Affect-incongruency in emotional responses to music","Recently, Friedman and his colleagues (2012; Taylor &amp; Friedman, 2015) proposed that prior research indicating a preference for sad music among individuals in sad affective states may in fact reflect an underlying reluctance to listen to happy music, an aversion driven by the belief that listening to such music would feel inappropriate and would be ineffective in mood repair. Given that individuals are often inaccurate in predicting their emotional responses, the question arises as to whether happy music is indeed ineffective in mitigating feelings of sadness. To test this, we conducted two experiments in which we induced participants into either sad or neutral affective states, randomly assigned them to listen to 1 of their favorite happy or sad songs, and measured the emotional impact of this listening experience. In both experiments, we also used a cover story and/or a bogus pipeline procedure to minimize artifacts from demand characteristics. Results revealed that happy music is highly effective at dispelling acute feelings of sadness, contrary to the intuitions expressed by participants in earlier studies. The findings also suggested that individuals in sad affective states do not feel much better and, in fact, may feel worse after listening to sad music. Together, these results point to potential limitations in individuals’ abilities to effectively regulate their emotions using music and challenge the notion that mood-congruent music is effective in alleviating sadness.

"568","Reinvestigating affect-congruency in music choice: Does misery really love company?","In this experiment, we resolved a number of the primary methodological limitations of prior studies so as to reinvestigate whether sadness fosters affect-congruency in music choice. To this end, we manipulated sad as well as neutral and happy affective states, using well-validated film-based inductions, measured music choice after rigorously controlling for differences in musical content and structure between expressively sad and happy music options, and used techniques borrowed from experimental social psychology to mitigate the potential for demand characteristics. Confirming prior lab-based and naturalistic findings, participants showed an overall tendency to prefer expressively happy over sad music; however, individuals in sad affective states failed to show any absolute tendency to favor sad music, calling into question the notion that “misery loves company” with respect to music choice. Supplementary findings revealed that individual differences in reflection, a form of private self-attentiveness, were associated with increased overall preference for sad music, yet that this effect was not moderated by induced affect. In sum, the present findings help clarify how both sadness and self-referential cognitive styles are associated with music preference.

"569","A potential pathway to the relapse of fear? Conditioned negative stimulus evaluation (but not physiological responding) resists instructed extinction","Relapse of fear after successful intervention is a major problem in clinical practice. However, little is known about how it is mediated. The current study investigated the effects of instructed extinction and removal of the shock electrode on electrodermal responding (Experiment 1), fear potentiated startle (Experiment 2), and a continuous self-report measure of conditional stimulus valence (Experiments 1 and 2) in human differential fear conditioning. Instructed extinction and removal of the shock electrode resulted in the immediate reduction of differential fear potentiated startle and second interval electrodermal responding, but did not affect self-reported conditional stimulus valence. A separate sample of participants (Experiment 3) who were provided with a detailed description of the experimental scenario predicted the inverse outcome, reduced differential stimulus evaluations and continued differential physiological responding, rendering it unlikely that the current results reflect on demand characteristics. These results suggest that the negative valence acquired during fear conditioning is less sensitive to cognitive interventions than are the physiological indices of human fear learning and that valence reduction requires extended exposure training. Persisting negative valence after cognitive intervention may contribute to fear relapse after successful treatment.

Surprisingly, and contrary to hedonic logic, previous experiments have demonstrated a relationship between picture viewing time and arousal (activation) but not with valence (pleasure vs. displeasure), suggesting that arousal rather than the hedonic principle accounts for how individuals choose to spend their time. In 2 experiments we investigated the arousal and hedonic principles underlying viewing time behavior while controlling for familiarity with stimuli, picture complexity, and demand characteristics. Under ad libitum conditions of picture viewing, we found strong relationships between viewing time, valence, and facial corrugator electomyographic (EMG) activity with familiar but not novel pictures. Viewing time of novel stimuli was largely associated with arousal and visual complexity. We conclude that only after initial information about the stimulus is gathered, where we choose to spend our time is guided by the hedonic principle.

"571","In (visual) search for a new distraction: The efficiency of a novel attentional deployment versus semantic meaning regulation strategies","Cognitive emotion regulation strategies are considered the king's highway to control affective reactions. Two broad categories of cognitive regulation are attentional deployment and semantic meaning. The basic distinctive feature between these categories is the type of conflict between regulatory and emotional processes for dominance, with an early attentional selection conflict in attentional deployment and a late appraisal selection conflict in semantic meaning. However, prior studies that tested the relative efficacy of these two regulatory categories varied the type and the degree of conflict. Our major goal was to test the relative efficacy of a novel attentional deployment strategy (visual search distraction) and a classic semantic meaning strategy (reappraisal) that have a different type of conflict but a matched degree of conflict. Specifically, visual search distraction involves a strong degree of attentional selection conflict manifested in attending subtle non-emotional features that are camouflaged within potent negative emotional stimuli. Reappraisal involves a strong degree of appraisal selection conflict manifested in construing neutral reappraisals that rely on potent negative emotional appraisals. Based on our theoretical model we hypothesized and found that visual search distraction was as effective as cognitive reappraisal in down-regulating the experience of low intensity of negative emotion (Study 1), but more effective, less effortful, and more strongly blocking emotional information processing than cognitive reappraisal when regulating high intensity (Study 2). A final study ruled out a demand characteristics explanation by showing that participants' expectations about how they should feel diverged from how they actually reported feeling following regulation (Study 3). Our findings suggest that the basic difference in the type rather than degree of conflict between attentional deployment and semantic meaning determines strategies' outcome.

"572","Further analysis of the Competitive Prosocial/Aggression Continuum Task","The Competitive Prosocial/Aggression Continuum Task (COMPACT) (Biondolillo, 2010) was developed in order to create an improved reaction time paradigm for aggression that reduces demand characteristics and increases the scope of research applications available in previous designs by using a behavioral response palette of both aversive and pleasant auditory stimuli to model both aggressive and prosocial behaviors. Initial validation research on the COMPACT demonstrated significant correlations between aggressive responding and several scales of interest; however, such correlations demonstrated smaller effects than the medium-sized effects predicted based on the literature available on similar reaction time paradigms, and pleasant response options on the COMPACT had not been shown to function as a valid measure of prosocial tendency. Thus, the primary goal of this project was to further develop the construct validity of the COMPACT, with particular emphasis on the impact of recent program modifications, including different opponent stimuli sets (aggressive vs. prosocial opponent) and the addition of extreme response options. This study establishes significant evidence justifying the use of the COMPACT as a behavioral measure of aggressive and prosocial behavior, and it demonstrates significant differences in responding and patterns of convergent and discriminant validity based on manipulation of the opponent behavior.

"574","A laboratory analogue of mirrored-self misidentification delusion: The role of hypnosis, suggestion, and demand characteristics","Mirrored-self misidentification is the delusional belief that one’s own reflection in the mirror is a stranger. In two experiments, we tested the ability of hypnotic suggestion to model this condition. In Experiment 1, we compared two suggestions based on either the delusion’s surface features (seeing a stranger in the mirror) or underlying processes (impaired face processing). Fifty-two high hypnotisable participants received one of these suggestions either with hypnosis or without in a wake control. In Experiment 2, we examined the extent to which social cues and role-playing could account for participants’ behaviour by comparing the responses of 14 hypnotised participants to the suggestion for impaired face processing (reals) with those of 14 nonhypnotised participants instructed to fake their responses (simulators). Overall, results from both experiments confirm that we can use hypnotic suggestion to produce a compelling analogue of mirrored-self misidentification that cannot simply be attributed to social cues or role-playing.

"575","The role of facial feedback in the modulation of clinically-relevant ambiguity resolution","Two experiments investigated the effect of facial expressions on clinically-relevant ambiguity resolution in a nonclinical sample. Experiment 1 investigated the effect of negative facial feedback (frowning) on a basic threat-interpretation bias procedure using a homophone spelling task and found that participants in a frowning condition interpreted significantly more threat/neutral homophones as threats than did participants in a neutral control condition. Experiment 2 investigated how frowning affected interpretation of bodily sensations. The findings indicated that participants in the frowning condition generated fewer positive consequences for bodily sensation scenarios and also rated the imagined bodily sensations as more negative and more of a cause for health concern. These effects could not simply be explained by differences in self-reported mood or by demand characteristics. These findings suggest that facial expressions have a moderating effect on the cognitive processes that contribute to clinically-relevant ambiguity resolution, and this has implications for clinical interventions.

Figure 7 was erroneously identical to Figure 4. The correct version of Figure 7 appears in the correction.] Using a novel autobiographical think/no-think procedure (ATNT; a modified version of the think/no-think task), 2 studies explored the extent to which we possess executive control over autobiographical memory. In Study 1, 30 never-depressed participants generated 12 positive and 12 negative autobiographical memories. Memories associated with cue–personal word pairings were learned to criterion. Participants were then asked to recall the memory associated with some of the cue–personal word pairs (i.e., think condition) or to avoid saying or thinking about the memory associated with others (i.e., no-think condition). In a subsequent test of recall, systematic forgetting effects emerged for no-think autobiographical memories compared to baseline that received neither no-think nor think instructions. These findings were extended and replicated in a second ATNT study (using a further 30 never-depressed participants), which showed that the forgetting of autobiographical memories in the no-think condition was unlikely to be a function of thought substitution or demand characteristics.

"577","Transportation into literary fiction reduces prejudice against and increases empathy for Arab-Muslims","In two studies, indirect out-group contact via narrative fiction was shown to foster empathic growth and reduce prejudice. Participants read an excerpt from a fictional novel about a counter stereotypical Arab-Muslim woman. Individuals who were more transported into the story rated Arab-Muslims significantly lower in stereotypical negative traits (Study 1, N = 67) and exhibited significantly lower negative attitudes toward Arab-Muslims (Study 2, N = 102) post-reading than individuals who were less transported into the story. These effects persisted after construing for baseline Arab-Muslim prejudice, reading-induced mood change, and demand characteristics. Affective empathy for Arab-Muslims and intrinsic motivation to reduce prejudice were also significantly increased by the story and each provided independent explanatory mechanisms for transportation's association with prejudice reduction. Narrative fiction offers a safe and rich context in which exposure and understanding of an out-group can occur and can easily be incorporated in educational and applied settings.

"578","Violent video games stress people out and make them more aggressive","It is well known that violent video games increase aggression, and that stress increases aggression. Many violent video games can be stressful because enemies are trying to kill players. The present study investigates whether violent games increase aggression by inducing stress in players. Stress was measured using cardiac coherence, defined as the synchronization of the rhythm of breathing to the rhythm of the heart. We predicted that cardiac coherence would mediate the link between exposure to violent video games and subsequent aggression. Specifically, we predicted that playing a violent video game would decrease cardiac coherence, and that cardiac coherence, in turn, would correlate negatively with aggression. Participants ( N = 77) played a violent or nonviolent video game for 20 min. Cardiac coherence was measured before and during game play. After game play, participants had the opportunity to blast a confederate with loud noise through headphones during a reaction time task. The intensity and duration of noise blasts given to the confederate was used to measure aggression. As expected, violent video game players had lower cardiac coherence levels and higher aggression levels than did nonviolent game players. Cardiac coherence, in turn, was negatively related to aggression. This research offers another possible reason why violent games can increase aggression—by inducing stress. Cardiac coherence can be a useful tool to measure stress induced by violent video games. Cardiac coherence has several desirable methodological features as well: it is noninvasive, stable against environmental disturbances, relatively inexpensive, not subject to demand characteristics, and easy to use.

Participants ( N = 650) completed single-item and FFQ measures of behavior and motivation at baseline before being randomized to one of six conditions in a between-persons design. Intention to treat analysis revealed that for the single-item measure: (1) a single implementation intention is an effective means of initiating fruit and vegetable increase over a 3-month period, but this effect is not sustained over 6 months; (2) administering a second implementation intention at 3 months was successful in increasing intake over 6 months, and acted as a booster on the initial impact; and (3) neither the passive nor active control condition had any impact on behavior. However, no effects of the manipulations on fruit and vegetable intake were found when behavior was assessed by the FFQ measure. Secondary analyses showed that reported increases in intake were not related to demand characteristics. The findings are discussed in relation to their conceptual and practical value.

"580","Behavioral persistence in carrying out a posthypnotic suggestion beyond the hypnotic context: A consideration of the role of perceived demand characteristics","Compliance with a posthypnotic suggestion (PHS) to carry out a specific behavior in a subsequent nonhypnotic setting was investigated in high and medium hypnotizable participants. The target behavior—solicited by either a PHS given during hypnosis, a waking social request, or both—was to be performed daily for an unspecified period of time. Findings indicated that the waking request alone yielded a high level of compliance, particularly among medium hypnotizable participants. In contrast, highly hypnotizable participants who received the PHS coupled with instructions for posthypnotic amnesia exhibited considerable variation in responding, whereas high hypnotizables, who received either a waking request, or a combination of PHS and waking request, performed similarly to medium hypnotizables. Postexperimental interview data suggest that perceived demand characteristics may contribute to variation in the persistence of posthypnotic behavior outside the hypnotic context.

"581","How does facial feedback modulate emotional experience?","Contracting muscles involved in facial expressions (e.g. smiling or frowning) can make emotions more intense, even when unaware one is modifying expression [e.g. Strack, F., Martin, L., &amp; Stepper, S. (1988). Inhibiting and facilitating conditions of the human smile: A non-obtrusive test of the facial feedback hypothesis. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 54 (5), 768–777]. However, it is unresolved whether and how inhibiting facial expressions might weaken emotional experience. In the present study, 142 participants watched positive and negative video clips while either inhibiting their facial expressions or not. When hypothesis awareness and effects of distraction were experimentally controlled, inhibiting facial expressions weakened some emotional experiences. These findings provide new insight into ways that inhibition of facial expression can affect emotional experience: the link is not dependent on experimental demand, lay theories about connections between expression and experience, or the distraction involved in inhibiting one’s expressions.

"582","Comparing implementation intention interventions in relation to young adults’ intake of fruit and vegetables","This study tests whether the effectiveness of implementation intention-based interventions to increase fruit and vegetable intake in a young adult population can be enhanced using additional pre-intervention instructions and alternative formats; namely, an ‘if-then’ implementation intention versus a more general, ‘global’ plan that does not explicitly link a situational cue with a goal-directed response. Participants (N = 557) completed pre-test measures of planning, motivation and behaviour with respect to increasing their fruit and vegetable intake before being randomised to a 3 (intervention format: control vs . ‘if-then’ vs . ‘global’ implementation intentions) ×2 (pre-intervention instruction vs . no pre-intervention instruction) between-participants design. Results revealed a significant intervention format by time interaction, such that intake significantly increased by 0.50 portions in the if-then format condition compared with 0.31 in the global format and 0.01 in the control condition. These results suggest that ‘if-then’ manipulations are superior in promoting behaviour change in an applied setting. The use of pre-intervention instructions had no additional effect on behaviour, providing evidence for the efficacy of implementation intentions even when experimenter demand is reduced. Evidence is also presented to suggest that reported increases in intake are not related to demand characteristics.

"583","Short-term mood regulation: Cognitive, neural, and genetic associations","Short-term fluctuations in mood have significant effects on a multitude of outcomes. The ability to regulate one's mood therefore has potentially far-reaching implications. The current work addressed three sub-domains in the area of short-term mood regulation. Study 1 tested the hypothesis that recalled memories influence mood in a congruent direction, using experimental assignment to memory recall condition (positive, neutral, negative) and minimizing demand characteristics. Results from the first study confirmed this hypothesis. Study 2 focused on the role of prefrontal brain regions in the experience of and recovery from negative and positive emotions. Contrary to our hypotheses, prefrontal regions did not appear to be necessary for either the experience of or recovery from sadness or happiness. Individuals with damage to dorsal and lateral portions of prefrontal cortex exhibited a greater sadness response than did control participants and individuals with damage to ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Finally, in Study 3 we examined the effect of variability in the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) on neural activations during sad mood and sad mood regulation. We hypothesized that carriers of the short allele would show greater activity in brain areas associated with sad mood and depression, especially amygdala, during the sad mood and during mood regulation. Results demonstrated that the primary amygdala difference was during regulation of the sad mood, with greater activity among carriers of the short allele. Together these results further our understanding of the cognitive, neural, and genetic variables that are associated with short-term mood regulation, and suggest clear directions for future research.

Building on recent research on nonconscious goal pursuit, two experiments are presented that test whether activating the goal of helping outside people’s awareness by exposure to social stereotypes causes them to overcome physical and social obstacles. Experiment 1 established that although overall participants were less inclined to pick up a tissue that was accidentally dropped on the floor by the experimenter when this tissue was dirty instead of clean, they were able to overcome their aversion toward picking up the physical object when they were primed with the mental representation of a social group (e.g., nurse) containing the goal of helping. Results were replicated in Experiment 2, in which participants had to overcome a social obstacle by providing feedback to a student of a negatively evaluated ethnic minority group, and explanations in terms of demand characteristics and mood were excluded. Implications for the literature on nonconscious goal pursuit are briefly discussed.

"585","The Red Herring technique: A methodological response to the problem of demand characteristics","In past research, we planted false memories for food related childhood events using a simple false feedback procedure. Some critics have worried that our findings may be due to demand characteristics. In the present studies, we developed a novel procedure designed to reduce the influence of demand characteristics by providing an alternate magnet for subjects' natural suspicions. We used two separate levels of deception. In addition to giving subjects a typical untrue rationale for the study (i.e., normal deceptive cover story), we built in strong indicators (the ""Red Herring"") that the study actually had another purpose. Later, we told subjects that we had deceived them, and asked what they believed the ""real purpose"" of the study was. We also interviewed a subset of subjects in depth in order to analyze their subjective experiences of the procedure and any relevant demand. Our Red Herring successfully tricked subjects, and left little worry that our false memory results were due to demand. This ""double cross"" technique may have widespread uses in psychological research that hopes to conceal its real hypotheses from experimental subjects.

Before beginning the present study, a confederate informed participants (N = 100) of the study's purported hypothesis. Participants then performed a laboratory task designed to evaluate the extent to which they would respond in ways that may confirm or disconfirm the hypothesis of the study. The authors found that participants tended to respond in ways that confirmed the hypothesis, yet this tendency depended on attitudes toward the experiment or experimenter and other individual differences. In addition, results suggested that suspicion probes may be ineffective in measuring participants' previous knowledge and suspicion.

"587","Person comparison and the set-size effect in impression formation","Exp. I with 46 undergraduates, and 2 replications with an independent-groups design failed to demonstrate a set-size effect. Subsequent experiments explored the roles of person comparison and demand characteristics in the set-size effect. Exp. II, with 84 Ss, showed a highly significant, largely linear set-size effect for simultaneous exposure to several sketches, but not for exposure to a single sketch. In Exp. III, with 98 Ss, which featured successive exposure to several sketches, significant linear set-size effects were obtained in the target-1st and -2nd conditions; however, the significant set-size effect for target-3rd was quadratic. Dry-run simulations of Exp. II and III, respectively, failed to support a demand-characteristic interpretation. It is concluded that the magnitude and form of set-size effects depend on (a) whether person comparison is available, and (b) whether the comparative information is exposed simultaneously or successively.

In the low credibility condition Ss who believed change was not expected did not change; while those who had not come to this conclusion changed. In the high credibility condition most Ss were aware that change was expected and they changed dramatically more than unawares. Results are interpreted as suggesting that, in general, demand characteristics and persuasion are confounded in laboratory opinion experiments, but the results of manipulations like communicator credibility may be entirely due to the demand characteristics of the situation.

Oakes (see 41:1), demand awareness correlates better with the conditioned ratings than does contingency awareness. A direct test of learning of the associations between the visual and the spoken word lists also correlates highly with ""conditioning"" and the 2 awareness measures. The independent variable of psychological sophistication of Ss (time of semester) and a manipulation of the difficulty of making interlist associations are also significant as predicted. Results are interpreted as challenging a conditioning interpretation of the Staats' effect. The effect seems to be an artifact of the demand characteristics of the experimental situation. (17 ref.)

"595","Differential effects of ward settings on psychiatric staff","DEALS WITH THE REACTIONS WHICH DIFFERENT INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC WARD SETTINGS ELICIT IN DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PSYCHIATRIC STAFF MEMBERS. STAFF MEMBERS WERE ASKED TO DESCRIBE THEIR REACTIONS IN 8 WARD SETTINGS, E.G., INDIVIDUAL THERAPY, GROUP THERAPY, AND COMMUNITY MEETING, AS WELL AS ON 33 ADJECTIVE PAIRS, E.G., ATTENTIVE-INATTENTIVE, FRIENDLY-HOSTILE, AND OUTGOING-SHY. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT DIFFERENT WARD SETTINGS WERE IMPORTANT BOTH BECAUSE THEY TENDED, TO SOME EXTENT, TO ELICIT THE SAME REACTIONS FROM ALL STAFF MEMBERS, AND BECAUSE THEY ALSO TENDED, TO SOME EXTENT, TO ELICIT DIFFERENT REACTIONS FROM DIFFERENT STAFF SUBGROUPS. THE RESULTS IMPLY THAT IN ATTEMPTING TO UNDERSTAND OR PREDICT STAFF BEHAVIOR, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO KNOW BOTH ABOUT THE STAFF MEMBER WHOSE BEHAVIOR IS BEING PREDICTED, AND ABOUT THE WARD SETTING IN WHICH THE BEHAVIOR IS BEING PREDICTED. A STAFF MEMBER MAY REACT QUITE DIFFERENTLY, DEPENDING UPON WHAT WARD SETTING HE IS IN; THE SAME SETTING MAY ELICIT QUITE DIFFERENT REACTIONS FROM DIFFERENT SUBGROUPS OF STAFF MEMBERS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT RESEARCH DIRECTED TOWARD THE MEASUREMENT OF THE RELEVANT DEMAND CHARACTERISTICS OF DIFFERENT WARD SETTINGS SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE GOAL OF THE MAXIMALLY SUCCESSFUL UTILIZATION OF INDIVIDUAL STAFF MEMBERS IN A THERAPEUTIC MILIEU.

"603","Body positive media: Effects of media type on risk factors for eating disorders","Eating disorders, specifically anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), have been associated with a variety of risk factors, including genetic heritability, personality factors, and sociocultural factors. Western culture's emphasis on thin body types in popular media has been identified as a contributor to the development of body dissatisfaction and disordered eating behaviors, through the internalization of this thin-ideal as the standard for beauty and attractiveness. However, a recent movement promoting body positivity, which focuses on body acceptance and diversity, has gained popularity on social media sites, particularly Instagram. The effects of body positive media on body dissatisfaction, thin-ideal internalization, and mood have not been examined as extensively as thin-ideal media. The current study explored the impact of exposure to images from social media that challenge the thin-ideal paradigm on body dissatisfaction, mood, and thin-ideal internalization. The sample consisted of 216 female-identifying students from a mid-sized, rural mid-Atlantic university. Results showed that relationships between thin-ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, disordered eating behaviors, and self-esteem are consistent with previous research. However, exposure to either body positive or thin-ideal media did not cause changes in participants' ratings of positive mood, body dissatisfaction, or thin-ideal internalization immediately following media exposure or after a delay. Explanations for these findings are discussed in light of historical, methodological, and participant factors, including whether diminished face validity and demand characteristics reduces the impact of media exposure.

"604","Throwing the baby out with the bathwater: When can we trust self report with the SMI inpatient population?","Reliability of self-report outcome assessment is often called into question with the severely mentally ill population. In the context of inpatient care, demand characteristics may further complicate self-report measures. Although clinician-completed outcome measures, such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Expanded Version (BPRS-E), have become industry standard with this population, self-report assessment may be useful under certain conditions. This study sought to explore the relationship between a clinician-completed, the BPRS-E, and a self-completed measure, the SOQ, within the SMI inpatient population. A total of 357 adult participants with a minimum of three assessment iterations were analyzed. The results of the analysis indicated both measures correlated at all assessment iterations (admission, 90-, 180-, 270-, 360+ days), but when divided into SOQ admission clinical and subclinical groups only the clinical group maintained the correlation at all points. A logistical regression analysis indicated that membership in the subclinical group can be predicted by one subscale (Mood Disturbance) and three items (Hallucinations, Uncooperativeness, and Conceptual Disorganization) from the BPRS-E. The change trajectories of both measures were essentially identical; however, when divided into SOQ admission clinical and subclinical scores the SOQ and BPRS-E change trajectories were significantly different from each other and clinical versus subclinical on the same measure were significantly different. Further examination of the subclinical SOQ group revealed two distinct groups, scores that eventually had reliable change and exceeded the cutoff score and those that never did. A logistical regression analyses revealed that membership in these two groups can be reliably predicted by two BPRS-E items (Somatic Concerns and Suspiciousness), in that as each item increases the likelihood of membership in the group that never exceeds the cutoff score also increases. These results suggest that although the SMI inpatient population present with profound limitations, it may be possible to predict those who will eventually provide reliable self-report outcome assessments and those who will not. Although further research is necessary, these results are promising and may provide decision points for clinicians on when and when not to trust self-report outcome assessment with the SMI inpatient population.

"605","Consumer learning from own experience and social information: An experimental study","We investigate how different types of social information affect the demand characteristics of firms competing through service quality. We first generate behavioral hypotheses around both consumers' learning behavior and firms' corresponding demand characteristics: market share, demand uncertainty, and rate of convergence. We then conduct a controlled human-subject experiment where a consumer chooses to visit one of two firms, each with unknown service quality, in a repeated interaction and is exposed to different information treatments from a social network: (1) no social information, (2) share-based social information which details the percentage of people that visited each firm, (3) quality-based social information which illustrates the percentage of people that received a satisfactory experience from each firm, or (4) full social information which contains both share-based and quality-based social information. A key insight from our study is that different types of social information have different effects on firms' demand. First, promoting quality-based social information leads to a significantly higher market share, lower demand variability, and faster rate of convergence, for a firm with significantly better service quality. Second, when the higher quality firm has only a marginal advantage over the other firm, promoting only share-based information leads to higher market share and lower demand variability. A third important result is that providing only one type of social information can actually be more helpful to the higher quality firm than providing full social information.

"606","Happiness from treating the weekend like a vacation","Americans are time-poor. They work long hours and leave paid vacation days unused. An analysis of over 200,000 U.S. workers reveals that not prioritizing vacation is linked to lower happiness. Many people, however, do not feel they can take vacation due to financial and temporal constraints. How might people enjoy the emotional benefits of vacation without taking additional time off or spending additional money? Three preregistered experiments tested the effect of simply treating the weekend “like a vacation” (vs. “like a regular weekend”) on subsequent happiness—measured as more positive affect, less negative affect, and greater satisfaction when back at work on Monday. Although unable to definitively rule out the role of demand characteristics, the study results suggest that treating the weekend like a vacation can increase happiness, and exploratory analyses show support for the underlying role of increased attention to the present moment.

"607","The repeated-suspect effect: What is the effect of repeated identification attempts on eyewitness accuracy and the original memory for the culprit?","Police routinely give eyewitnesses multiple opportunities to identify the same suspect, and numerous exoneration cases demonstrate that this practice can contribute to wrongful convictions. Empirical research addressing this practice shows it can lead to the repeated-suspect effect, which is a significant increase in suspect identifications after the same suspect has been presented in a previous showup or lineup (Steblay &amp; Dysart, 2016). Procedures that tend to increase the chance of innocent suspect identifications are considered suggestive and produce unreliable eyewitness decisions. Thus, the use of multiple identification opportunities is considered suggestive and are discouraged by researchers (Wells et al., 2020). Despite this, eyewitness testimony obtained using suggestive procedures is frequently used at trial anyway because it is still admissible in court if other criteria are met indicating the identification was ""nevertheless reliable"" (Manson v. Brathwaite, 1977; Wells &amp; Quinlivan, 2009). This dissertation builds on past research in this area by examining the effect of more the one intervening lineup and biased intervening lineups containing the same innocent suspect in two experiments, and how these different intervening lineup manipulations impact identification outcomes, confidence, and mechanism-related questions.Participants in both experiments watched a crime video, completed an intervening task phase, then evaluated a final, fair lineup. For Experiment 1, the intervening tasks were a fair lineup, a biased lineup, or a reading comprehension control task, and the final lineup contained either an innocent suspect, repeated from the intervening lineup, or the true culprit embedded among five fillers. For both studies, a repeated-suspect effect occurred such that a fair intervening lineup containing the innocent suspect resulted in more misidentifications of that same innocent suspect in the final lineup, consistent with past research. Furthermore, when participants received an intervening lineup that was biased towards the repeated innocent suspect, the repeated-suspect effect was more pronounced with significantly more innocent suspect picks from the final lineup when compared with participants who received a fair intervening lineup. Similarly, in Experiment 2, presenting participants with two intervening lineups exacerbated repeated-suspect effects relative to only one intervening lineup, particularly when one of those intervening lineups was biased. In Experiment 1, participants who received a final lineup containing the culprit were equally able to identify the culprit regardless of the intervening task condition, indicating that the memory for the true culprit was maintained despite exposure to misleading intervening lineups. Overall, these studies confirm that multiple identification attempts that each contain the same innocent suspect decreases the reliability of eyewitness decisions and increases the risk of misidentification for the innocent suspect. Moreover, these effects become stronger when the intervening lineups are biased or when more intervening lineups are introduced. Post-identification questions were also used to determine how the repetition manipulation and lineup bias manipulation might influence the relative contribution of two cognitive (dual-process recognition and source misattribution) and two social (commitment and demand characteristics) mechanisms for repeated-suspect effects. These self-report measures were used to speculate about how these processes are involved in creating repeated-suspect effects and to encourage future research addressing non-memory mechanisms in eyewitness identification research.

"608","Attention increases environmental risk perception","The authors suggest that mere attention increases the perceived severity of environmental risks because attention increases the fear and distinctiveness of attended risks. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants were exposed to images of multiple environmental risks, with attention repeatedly oriented to a subset of these risks. Participants subsequently perceived attended risks to be more severe, more frightening, higher priority, and more distinctive than control risks. In Experiments 3 and 4, spatial cueing manipulations were used to briefly draw attention toward some risks and away from others. In Experiment 3, a briefly flashed rectangle drew attention toward one side of a computer screen just before 2 images depicting different risks appeared: 1 image near to where the rectangle appeared and 1 further away. In Experiment 4, incidental attention was cued toward some risks by giving participants an unrelated letter search task that required them to briefly attend near that location. Participants in Experiments 3 and 4 selected cued (attended) risks as more severe, distinctive, and frightening than noncued risks. Across experiments, serial mediation analyses indicated that the effect of the attention manipulation on severity was mediated by the effect of attention on fear which was mediated by distinctiveness. Across experiments, we equated duration of exposure to risks and sought to minimize demand characteristics.

"609","Observers use facial masculinity to make physical dominance assessments following 100-ms exposure","Research has consistently demonstrated that faces manipulated to appear more masculine are perceived as more dominant. These studies, however, have used forced-choice paradigms, in which a pair of masculinized and feminized faces was presented side by side. These studies are susceptible to demand characteristics, because participants may be able to draw the conclusion that faces which appear more masculine should be rated as more dominant. To prevent this, we tested if dominance could be perceived when masculinized or feminized faces were presented individually for only 100 ms. We predicted higher dominance ratings to masculinized faces and better memory of them in a surprise recognition memory test. In the experiment, 96 men rated the physical dominance of 40 facial photographs (masculinized = 20, feminized = 20), which were randomly drawn from a larger set of faces. This was followed by a surprise recognition memory test. Half of the participants were assigned to a condition in which the contours of the facial photographs were set to an oval to control for sexual dimorphism in face shape. Overall, men assigned higher dominance ratings to masculinized faces, suggesting that they can appraise differences in facial sexual dimorphism following very brief exposure. This effect occurred regardless of whether the outline of the face was set to an oval, suggesting that masculinized internal facial features were sufficient to affect dominance ratings. However, participants' recognition memory did not differ for masculinized and feminized faces, which could be due to a floor effect.

"610","Selective directed forgetting: Eliminating output order and demand characteristics explanations","Previous research has shown that giving an instruction to forget part of a studied list of items impairs the subsequent retrieval of these items compared with those not cued to be forgotten. This selective directed forgetting (SDF) effect has been found with slightly different procedures and in adolescents and young adults. While recent research has suggested that executive control might underlie SDF, alternative explanations that rely on procedural issues still have not been investigated. Specifically, SDF might essentially reflect output interference from the items cued to be remembered, so that the earlier recalled items interfere with the later recalled items. The effect could also result from demand characteristics: Participants might withhold the to-be-forgotten items to comply with the experimenter’s implicit goals or might not be willing to engage in the effort of retrieving all studied information. The results from two experiments showed that (1) the to-be-forgotten items were less accessible and were not influenced by output interference from to-be-remembered items (Experiment 1), and (2) SDF was still present when participants were offered monetary reward for retrieving as many items as possible (Experiment 2). Hence, the findings do not provide support to explanations of SDF based on output interference and demand characteristics.

"611","Reliability and validity of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) as a measure of Change Agenda","This research examined the reliability and validity of the Change Agenda Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (CA-IRAP). Change agendas that lead people to think that “reducing or removing undesirable thoughts and feelings will solve problems and lead to a more successful life” are considered unworkable in acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). For acceptance-based interventions to succeed, relinquishing change agendas is important. However, currently available methods for measuring these types of change agendas are limited to explicit measures, which are vulnerable to distortion from social desirability and demand characteristics. The authors attempted to measure change agendas using the IRAP. A total of 131 undergraduate and graduate students (40 male, 91 female; mean age = 21.93, SD = 3.19) participated. First, we examined the CA-IRAP’s discriminant validity in relation to explicit measures such as the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II in 83 participants who were able to pass the CA-IRAP. The correlations between the CA-IRAP and the explicit measures were low, confirming the discriminant validity of the CA-IRAP. Second, we examined the predictive validity of the CA-IRAP. Nineteen respondents had learned ACT and 34 respondents had never learned ACT. Non-ACT learners’ CA-IRAP scores were higher than those of ACT learners, which confirmed the CA-IRAP’s predictive validity. Finally, we examined the CA-IRAP’s test–retest reliability, which was confirmed across some CA-IRAP trial types. In conclusion, the authors submit that the CA-IRAP has strong potential as a valid instrument for measuring the relative strength of relational responses around change agendas while controlling for variables such as demand characteristics.

"612","Mindfulness training for emotion dysregulation in multiple sclerosis: A pilot randomized controlled trial","Objective: People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) report greater emotion dysregulation, which is associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety, and reduced quality of life. Given the transdiagnostic significance of emotion dysregulation, the current study was designed to assess the feasibility and treatment effects of mindfulness meditation in reducing emotion dysregulation for PwMS. Method: Sixty-one PwMS were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: 4-week mindfulness-based training (MBT), 4-week adaptive cognitive training (aCT), or a waitlist control group. Using self-report and behavioral measures, we examined the effects of MBT on emotion dysregulation, use of emotion regulation strategies, experience of negative and positive affect, and overall quality of life. Results: Mindfulness training was associated with reduced emotion dysregulation compared with the adaptive cognitive training and the waitlist control group (<U+03B7> p ² = .20). Relative to the waitlist group, the MBT group also demonstrated reductions on a composite score of preservative cognition, measuring rumination and worry (<U+03B7> p ² = .15). However, there was no differential use of emotion regulation strategies or between-groups differences in overall quality of life as a function of training. Conclusions: Our pilot study provides preliminary support for MBT to reduce self-reported emotion dysregulation in PwMS. Given the widespread prevalence of mental health disturbances in this population, MBT can serve as a promising rehabilitation tool for PwMS (clinicaltrials.gov # NCT02717429).

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-21392-001). Perceived nose elongation resulting from vibratory stimulation to the bicep brachii tendon in the absence of visual input while the finger is touching the nose, known as the Pinocchio Illusion (PI), is used to investigate how afferent signals can contribute to aberrant top-down perception of body representation. The Pinocchio Illusion Questionnaire (PIQ) was developed to empirically quantify PI perception, allowing for external validation of the PI with psychologically relevant phenomenon. The current study (N = 60) examined the PIQ’s test-retest reliability, internal consistency, factor structure, and correlations with self-reported interoceptive awareness and schizotypal traits. The PIQ demonstrated strong test-retest reliability and internal validity; however, a Principal Component Analysis did not yield a latent variable structure that distinguished PI-specific perceptual aberrations from unrelated or contradictory perceptual experiences. Additionally, decreased reports of PI-specific perceptual aberrations during two elicitations of the PI on the PIQ’s open-ended free-response section (percent of sample endorsement = 5% (first elicitation); 8.3% (second elicitation)) compared to its 11-item section (endorsement of PI-specific items ranging 30–53.33% (first)]; 31.67–46.67% (second)) suggest that these responses may be heavily influenced by demand characteristics rather than accurately capturing PI perception.

"614","Psychometric evaluation of the Pinocchio Illusion Questionnaire","[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 82(5) of Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics (see record 2020-50699-001). In the original article, there were some errors. The caption for Table 3 states: ""Blank spaces indicate less than 0.03 factor loading"" when it should indicate ""Blank spaces indicate less than 0.30 factor loading."" There is an unneeded bracket in the abstract of the paper, the following sentence should have read: ""Additionally, decreased reports of PI-specific perceptual aberrations during two elicitations of the PI on the PIQ’s open-ended free-response section (percentage of sample endorsement = 5%, [first elicitation]; 8.3% [second elicitation]) compared with its 11-item section (endorsement of PI-specific items ranging from 30% to 53.33% [first]; 31.67% to 46.67% [second]) suggest that these responses may be heavily influenced by demand characteristics rather than accurately capturing PI perception.""] Perceived nose elongation resulting from vibratory stimulation to the bicep brachii tendon in the absence of visual input while the finger is touching the nose, known as the Pinocchio Illusion (PI), is used to investigate how afferent signals can contribute to aberrant top-down perception of body representation. The Pinocchio Illusion Questionnaire (PIQ) was developed to empirically quantify PI perception, allowing for external validation of the PI with psychologically relevant phenomenon. The current study (N = 60) examined the PIQ’s test-retest reliability, internal consistency, factor structure, and correlations with self-reported interoceptive awareness and schizotypal traits. The PIQ demonstrated strong test-retest reliability and internal validity; however, a Principal Component Analysis did not yield a latent variable structure that distinguished PI-specific perceptual aberrations from unrelated or contradictory perceptual experiences. Additionally, decreased reports of PI-specific perceptual aberrations during two elicitations of the PI on the PIQ’s open-ended free-response section (percent of sample endorsement = 5% (first elicitation); 8.3% (second elicitation)) compared to its 11-item section (endorsement of PI-specific items ranging 30–53.33% (first)]; 31.67–46.67% (second)) suggest that these responses may be heavily influenced by demand characteristics rather than accurately capturing PI perception.

"615","From adolescence to young adulthood in two dream series: The consistency and continuity of characters and major personal interests","Based on several past studies of lengthy daily individual dream series, which are an unobtrusive, nonreactive archival measure, free of any demand characteristics, it has been established with adults over age 25 that dream content is consistent over years and even decades. In addition, dream content is often continuous with waking personal concerns as well, whether the concerns are positive (“interests,” “avocations”) or negative (“worries,” “preoccupations”; Domhoff, 2018, Chapters 3–4, for summaries of this work). The study presented in this article is a descriptive empirical investigation that explores the question of if and when consistency and continuity can be found in the teenage years or young adulthood. It is based primarily on individual dream series kept by 2 young women from early adolescence to young adulthood. They do not know each other and did not separately think about providing their dream reports to researchers until they were in their mid-20s. The analyses of these 2 series, one containing 4,329 dream reports, and the other containing 664 dream reports, are based on a quantitative word-search methodology, available through DreamBank.net. The resulting personalized word strings for each series combine the rigor of defined content categories with the speed and perfect reliability of computerized word searches. The findings on consistency and continuity during adolescence are similar to the earlier findings for adults.

"616","Intact counterfactual emotion processing in autism spectrum disorder: Evidence from eye-tracking","Counterfactual emotions, such as regret and relief, require an awareness of how things could have been different. We report a preregistered experiment that examines how adults with and without ASD process counterfactual emotions in real-time, based on research showing that the developmental trajectory of counterfactual thinking may be disrupted in people with ASD. Participants were eye-tracked as they read narratives in which a character made an explicit decision then subsequently experienced either a mildly negative or positive outcome. The final sentence in each story included an explicit remark about the character's mood that was either consistent or inconsistent with the character's expected feelings of regret or relief (e.g., “… she feels happy/annoyed about her decision.”). Results showed that adults with ASD are unimpaired in processing emotions based on counterfactual reasoning, and in fact showed earlier sensitivity to inconsistencies within relief contexts compared to TD participants. This finding highlights a previously unknown strength in empathy and emotion processing in adults with ASD, which may have been masked in previous research that has typically relied on explicit, response-based measures to record emotional inferences, which are likely to be susceptible to demand characteristics and response biases. Therefore, this study highlights the value of employing implicit measures that provide insights on peoples' immediate responses to emotional content without disrupting ongoing processing.

"617","Training novice practitioners to reliably report their meditation experience using shared phenomenological dimensions","Empirical descriptions of the phenomenology of meditation states rely on practitioners’ ability to provide accurate information on their experience. We present a meditation training protocol that was designed to equip naive participants with a theoretical background and experiential knowledge that would enable them to share their experience. Subsequently, novices carried on with daily practice during several weeks before participating in experiments. Using a neurophenomenological experiment designed to explore two different meditation states (focused attention and open monitoring), we found that self-reported phenomenological ratings (i) were sensitive to meditation states, (ii) reflected meditation dose and fatigue effects, and (iii) correlated with behavioral measures (variability of response time). Each of these effects was better predicted by features of participants’ daily practice than by desirable responding. Our results provide evidence that novice practitioners can reliably report their experience along phenomenological dimensions and warrant the future investigation of this training protocol with a longitudinal design.

"618","Redesigning a community-based challenging behaviour intensive support service","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss outcomes of a service redesign, involving an Intensive Support Team (IST) for adults with learning disabilities and challenging behaviour, working in conjunction with a Community Learning Disability Service (CLDS). Design/methodology/approach: Two IST staff were physically based as “Inreach workers” within a CLDS for six months. Inreach workers provided support with existing resources and consultation for specific clients presenting with challenging behaviour. CLDS staff confidence, understanding and implementation of existing challenging behaviour resources was evaluated before and after service redesign. An online questionnaire was used to gather further data relating to experiences of the Inreach project. Findings: CLDS staff confidence, understanding and implementation of existing challenging behaviour resources increased over the six-month inreach period. Questionnaire results indicated CLDS staff found Inreach support to be beneficial, having a perceived positive impact for clients, and providing clarity on the skills and resources provided by the IST. Research limitations/implications: The long-term effects of this pilot have yet to be established. Consideration is given to how demand characteristics may have influenced CLDS responses. Practical implications: Careful consideration should be given in terms of how ISTs interface with CLDSs. ISTs may consider being based physically within CLDSs, to provide more readily accessible support. Originality/value: Providing CLDS staff with more accessible support from ISTs may increase the effective implementation of available resources for adults with learning disabilities and challenging behaviour.

"619","Economics of esports","In this paper, esports market development is exhibited and analyzed through various data sources and literature review. Additionally, economic concepts are applied to the esports environment. Demand characteristics of this emerging market are analyzed by applying the concept of competitive balance as commonly used in economics of sport scrutiny. The elite esports demand is proxied by gathering data on total prize money in the elite esports tournaments and explaining the esports demand by testing various factors measuring the competitive market properties. The most commonly used measurement in economics of sport for measuring withinseason competitive balance is calculated as the actual standard deviation of winning percentages to the hypothesized ideal standard deviation. Nevertheless, unique market properties of esports require novel methods and measurements. Therefore, alternative methods for measuring competitive environment properties in esports markets are developed and tested. Statistical moment methods enable the measuring of the distributional properties of prize money deviation. Distributional information is applied for constructing various index measures for testing the esports market competitive balance and that information is modeled in regression estimations for explaining the demand properties of elite esports markets. One of the main contributions of this paper is to underline the different characteristics of the esports market compared to the traditional sport environment. Finally, esports market UOH testing results are contrasted with research findings from traditional elite sports markets. It appears that esports market demand is better modelled by applying “superstar” models by Rosen (1981) and Adler (1985) than traditional within-season variation UOH models.

"620","Noncognitive variables for placement: A randomized control trial","This study was born out of a concern that U.S. community colleges were currently using or considering using noncognitive variables for academic placement without an understanding of how students would react to these scales in a high-stakes setting. While the use of noncognitive variables for placement often stems from a desire to overcome the myriad of limitations of content-based placement tests, the researcher was concerned that noncognitive variables had the potential to become an extension of the problems caused by the test. This study was guided by two research questions: How does the high-stakes nature of academic placement impact student responses on noncognitive scales? How does the context, demand, characteristics, and framing of the noncognitive variables impact stereotype threat, if at all? The researcher performed a random control trial of incoming community college students to determine how they might react to questions about noncognitive variables. One group was told their responses would be used for placement, and the other was told that their responses would be used to improve instruction. The major findings suggest that initial framing played a role in participant responses and lowered responses on some noncognitive variables, but that the act of having taken a placement test was also a moderator of student behavior and whether or not students believed the initial framing. Stereotype threat susceptibility appeared to have a statistically significant relationship with some participants' responses on some noncognitive scales, and there was evidence that initial framing was not related. Finally, while participants were generally honest, those who did change their answers did so in a manner that was inconsistent, more so when given high stakes framing.

"621","Emotion regulation style as a predictor and target of change for cognitive training in post-traumatic stress disorder","Emotion regulation skills appear to be an important moderator of treatment among individuals struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This is one of the few studies to explore the role of two emotion regulation skills: cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, in predicting treatment response. Cognitive reappraisal is generally viewed as an adaptive emotion regulatory skill whereas expressive suppression is regarded as maladaptive. This study examined the extent to which cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression predicted treatment response to cognitive training among 84 individuals diagnosed with PTSD. Participants were randomly assigned to either a cognitive training condition or a control condition and were assessed using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) at pre- and post-treatment. The results indicated that expressive suppression at baseline was associated with more severe PTSD symptomatology. Use of cognitive reappraisal increased and use of cognitive suppression decreased from pre- to post-treatment regardless of treatment condition. We also found trend-level evidence that high reappraisers benefitted less than low reappraisers in the cognitive training condition. The results demonstrate the complicated nature of the relationship between emotion regulation styles (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) in relation to PTSD and cognitive training. Expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal may be important predictors of treatment response in cognitive training. The results suggest possible demand characteristics and that expressive suppression may be more strongly correlated with facets of PTSD compared to cognitive reappraisal. The near-significant result that individuals who reappraised less at baseline compared to those who reappraised more saw more reductions in PTSD symptom severity highlights the need for future research to examine how cognitive reappraisal moderates treatment during cognitive training.

"622","The interplay between moral actions and moral judgments in children and adults","Do choices about which moral actions to take cohere with subsequent judgments of their outcomes? The first set of experiments ( N = 60 preschoolers and 30 adults) directly compared whether moral choices and judgments reflect distinct considerations, and whether coherence varies based on the valence of the moral scenario. Participants’ responses suggested that moral principles may be applied differently for moral choices and judgments, and that harm-based situations are particularly demanding for children. To determine whether children’s difficulty with harm-based situations reflects demand characteristics, a second set of experiments presented forty-three preschoolers and thirty-nine adults with a moral dilemma wherein they could choose to omit an action and maximize harm or act to minimize harm. Both age groups acted to minimize harm when caused indirectly. These results suggest that making choices about harm are not unilaterally demanding for preschoolers, but they struggle to make choices that minimize harm in a forced-choice scenario.

"623","Trapped in a tight spot: Scaling effects occur when, according to the action-specific account, they should not, and fail to occur when they should","The action-specific account of perception claims that what we see is perceptually scaled according to our action capacity. However, it has been argued that this account relies on an overly confirmatory research strategy—predicting the presence of, and then finding, an effect (Firestone &amp; Scholl, 2014). A comprehensive approach should also test disconfirmatory predictions, in which no effect is expected. In two experiments, we tested one such prediction based on the action-specific account, namely that scaling effects should occur only when participants intend to act (Witt, Proffitt, &amp; Epstein, 2005). All participants wore asymmetric gloves in which one glove was padded with extra material, so that one hand was wider than the other. Participants visually estimated the width of apertures. The action-specific account predicts that the apertures should be estimated as being narrower for the wider hand, but only when participants intend to act. We found this scaling effect when it should not have occurred (Exp. 1, for participants who did not intend to act), as well as no effect when it should have occurred (Exp. 2, for participants who intended to act but were given a cover story for the visibility and position of their hands). Thus, the cover story used in Experiment 2 eliminated the scaling effect found in Experiment 1. We suggest that the scaling effect observed in Experiment 1 likely resulted from demand characteristics associated with using a salient, unexplained manipulation (e.g., telling people which hand to use to do the task). Our results suggest that the action-specific account lacks predictive power.

"624","A comparative study of a mentalization-based versus a psychodynamic group therapy session","Aims: The purpose of this study was to explore how mentalization-based group therapy (MBT-G) for patients with borderline personality disorder may be both different and similar to a more traditional psychodynamic group psychotherapy approach. Material and methods: The study is a comparative case-study examining a supposedly representative clinical example of MBT-G and a supposedly representative clinical example of a psychodynamic group (PDG). Both groups were composed mainly of patients with borderline personality disorder. The study used a mixed methodological approach with quantitative research methods, including MBT-G Adherence and Quality Scale and Reflective Functioning Scale (RF-scale), and qualitative content analysis. Results: 1) The MBT-G therapists focused consistently on mental states and emotions. This was reflected both in a significantly higher intervention frequency, and in a higher proportion of theoretically assumed mentalizing-promoting interventions. 2) We observed an increase in mentalizing (defined as RF) among some patients in the MBT-G group. In the PDG session, RF development were less systematic, and had lesser impact. 3) Interventions with ‘demand’ characteristics might play an important role in developing a mentalizing group discourse. 4) In both groups, therapists and patients actively structured the sessions, but the MBT-G session more explicitly engaged in ‘meta’ discussions about it, i.e. discussing whether a topic should or should not be put on the agenda. Conclusion: Despite similarities between the approaches, differences in choice of therapeutic focus and consistency suggest that the two methods engage patients in different therapy processes. The results warrant studies that include more sessions in order to validate or falsify the resulting hypotheses.

"625","Aging and altruism in intertemporal choice","In addition to making decisions about gains and losses that affect only ourselves, we often make decisions that affect others. Research on life span changes in motivation suggests that altruistic motives become stronger with age, but no prior research has examined how altruism affects tolerance for temporal delays. Experiment 1 used a realistic financial decision making task involving choices for gains, losses, and donations. Each decision required an intertemporal choice between a smaller-immediate and a larger-later option. Participants more often chose the larger-later option in the context of donations than in the context of losses; thus, parting with more of their overall capital when the act of doing so benefited a charity. As predicted, the magnitude of this “altruism effect” was amplified in older relative to younger adults. This pattern was replicated in a second experiment that was conducted online to minimize the influence of demand characteristics. Overall, these findings add to the literature on an age-related increase in altruism, and are the first to demonstrate its effects on intertemporal choice.

"626","Who did what: A novel method for investigating human mate preferences","The extant literature on human mate preferences demonstrates that mate preferences are difficult to measure: findings are surprisingly contradictory across methodologies. In self-report and vignette studies, traits related to cooperative partner or parental value, such as warmth, kindness, and trustworthiness, are found to be of paramount importance. These methods also tend to find the sex differences in preferences that are predicted by evolutionary theory, with men valuing physical attractiveness relatively more than women do, and women valuing social status or cues of resource acquisition ability relatively more than men do. However, methods like these where participants must consciously evaluate different traits and report their preferences for them are problematic, because of issues like social desirability bias, demand characteristics, and the fact that humans probably have little conscious insight into the majority of their cognitive programs. In research measuring revealed preferences, such as speed-dating studies, in which choices have real consequences for mating, cues of cooperative partner or parental value do not appear to influence attractiveness, and physical attractiveness is the main driver of mating choices, for both sexes. However, in speed-dating interactions, information about other relevant traits may be largely absent, and physical attractiveness may be the only trait that can be accurately assessed during such a brief encounter. The correlational nature of speeddating studies also precludes the ability to make causal claims. Thus, the validity of both self-reported preferences and revealed preferences from speed-dating research are questionable, and this literature is currently at an impasse. Here, we attempted to solve many of the issues in these previous methodologies with a novel experimental paradigm for assessing revealed preferences. We resurrected the memory confusion protocol developed by Taylor et al. (1978) and adapted it for the investigation of human mate preferences. This method afforded us experimental control, a strong but implicit manipulation of traits via behavioral information, and a built-in manipulation check by virtue of the memory confusion data that are emblematic of this protocol. Across a series of seven studies, we manipulated cues of kindness and social status or provisioning ability and tested effects on mate attractiveness. Opposite-sex targets represented by faces, who varied in physical attractiveness, were randomly paired with sentences describing behaviors that were pre-rated as indicating various levels of the manipulated traits. After viewing these pairings, subjects rated targets' mate attractiveness, and revealed preferences were assessed from these ratings. Results for kindness manipulations indicated that manipulated kindness positively predicted mate attractiveness ratings for both sexes. Unkind behaviors towards others were detrimental to the mate attractiveness of both sexes, and highly kind behaviors towards others had particularly positive effects on the mate attractiveness of female targets. Trends suggested that women especially valued high kindness by men when it was directed towards them compared to others. Findings from the first resource access study suggested that cues of social standing alone did not impact the mate attractiveness of either sex. However, behavioral information about provisioning ability had significant effects on the mate attractiveness of both sexes, with no clear sex difference in this effect. Physical attractiveness was consistently the strongest predictor of mate attractiveness, for both sexes.

"627","Processing speed in children: Examination of the structure in middle childhood and its impact on reading","The primary aim of this study was to examine the structure of processing speed (PS) in middle childhood by comparing five theoretically driven models of PS. The models consisted of two conceptual models (a unitary model, a complexity model) and three methodological models (a stimulus material model, an output modality model, and a timing modality model). A second aim was to evaluate the utility of these models for key reading skills (single word reading, fluency, and comprehension) relevant to this age group. Participants consisted of 844 children enrolled in urban public elementary schools. Average participant age was 9.92 (SD = 0.89) and students were enrolled in 3rd (n = 186), 4th (n = 482) and 5th (n = 176) grade. Sixteen variables from 12 tasks differing in their demand characteristics captured PS. Confirmatory factor analyses and regression equations evaluated hypotheses. A two-factor Timing model (Latency and Efficiency) was the strongest fit to the data and similarly structured two-factor Complexity model (Simple and Complex) was also a good fit to the data. Both models were examined as predictors of reading skills. Only the Efficiency/Complex factors were predictive of each key reading skill when considered alone and with relevant language and demographic variables, with the exception of single word reading, where both PS latent factors were predictive in the context of covariates. The structure of PS in middle childhood was found to form a two-factor structure, and separation was apparent between a simpler and more complex level of timed processing. Additionally, PS appears to be contributory to the prediction of word single word reading, reading fluency, and reading comprehension in the context of highly relevant predictors.

"628","What predicts university students' use of learning strategies? Perceived cognitive demands, instrumentality or personality","The current study investigated how college students' perception of cognitive demands, instrumentality and personality influent their learning strategies generally used for a specific course. A survey package consisting of a Cognitive Demands Questionnaire (Zhou, Phillips, &amp; Turner, 2012), the Instrumentality Questionnaire (Husman &amp; Lens, 1999), the Big-Five Personality Questionnaire (John, Donahue &amp; Kentle, 1991), and part of the Motivated Learning Strategies Questionnaire (31 items for measuring cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies ,Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, &amp; McKeachie, 1991) was administered to 494 participants near the end of the semester when students have already completed most of the course content and assignments. The results revealed that 1) Compared to personality traits and instrumentality, cognitive demands are stronger and more direct predictors for explaining students' use of learning strategies; 2) Most personality traits associated with impulse control only have indirect influence on learning strategies through the coordination of self-regulation; 3) Self-regulation has a special role of coordinating cognitive demands, instrumentality and personality. The present results shed light on the very important role played by the local context of the specific demand characteristics of the assignments of a given course.

"629","Feasibility of biochemical verification in a web-based smoking cessation study","Background and aims: Cogent arguments have been made against the need for biochemical verification in population-based studies with low-demand characteristics. Despite this fact, studies involving digital interventions (low-demand) are often required in peer review to report biochemically verified abstinence. To address this discrepancy, we examined the feasibility and costs of biochemical verification in a web-based study conducted with a national sample. Methods: Participants were 600 U.S. adult current smokers who registered on a web-based smoking cessation program and completed surveys at baseline and 3 months. Saliva sampling kits were sent to participants who reported 7-day abstinence at 3 months, and analyzed for cotinine. Results: The response rate at 3-months was 41.2% (n = 247): 93 participants reported 7-day abstinence (38%) and were mailed a saliva kit (71% returned). The discordance rate was 36.4%. Participants with discordant responses were more likely to report 3-month use of nicotine replacement therapy or e-cigarettes than those with concordant responses (79.2% vs. 45.2%, p = 0.007). The total cost of saliva sampling was $8280 ($125/sample). Conclusions: Biochemical verification was both time- and cost-intensive, and yielded a relatively small number of samples due to low response rates and use of other nicotine products during the follow-up period. There was a high rate of discordance of self-reported abstinence and saliva testing. Costs for data collection may be prohibitive for studies with large sample sizes or limited budgets. Our findings echo previous statements that biochemical verification is not necessary in population-based studies, and add evidence specific to technology-based studies.

"630","Cognitive functioning in schizotypy through the lens of the accessibility model","Introduction: Individuals with schizotypy self-report subjective cognitive complaints commensurate with deficits reported by individuals with schizophrenia. In contrast to schizophrenia, objective deficits in memory are modest in individuals with schizotypy, as compared to their self-reported cognitive complaints. It has been proposed that abnormalities in semantic memory systems may underlie this dysjunction. Methods: This study employed a modified verbal memory paradigm in a sample of 87 individuals with psychometrically defined schizotypy. Appraisals of memory performance were evaluated across global (i.e. drawing on semantic memory systems and assessing perceived typical performance) and situation-specific (i.e. drawing on episodic memory systems) epochs. Objective memory performance was assessed using a verbal recall paradigm. Results: Individuals with schizotypy did not differ in situation-specific appraisals or in objective memory performance. Global appraisals of memory performance predicted negative and disorganised schizotypy scores. No other measure of memory performance predicted any facet of schizotypy. Individuals with schizotypy appraised their global memory performance higher than controls at a medium effect. Conclusions: Higher order global appraisals of cognitive performance, subsumed within semantic networks, may be important in the subjective–objective paradox in schizotypy, suggesting the importance of considering demand characteristics when assessing measures of neurocognitive performance in individuals with schizotypy.

"631","“Panic and comorbid depression and their associations with stress reactivity, interoceptive awareness and interoceptive accuracy of various bioparameters”: Corrigendum","Reports an error in ""Panic and comorbid depression and their associations with stress reactivity, interoceptive awareness and interoceptive accuracy of various bioparameters"" by Jan Limmer, Johannes Kornhuber and Alexandra Martin ( Journal of Affective Disorders , 2015[Oct][1], Vol 185, 170-179). In the original article, the authors inadvertently omitted a statement declaring the research and subsequent research report to be part of the dissertation of the first author according to the doctoral regulations for obtaining the degree ""Dr. rer. biol. hum."" (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-39376-026). Background: While current theories on perception of interoceptive signals suggest impaired interoceptive processing in psychiatric disorders such as panic disorder or depression, heart-rate (HR) interoceptive accuracy (IAc) of panic patients under resting conditions is superior to that of healthy controls. Thus, in this study, we chose to assess further physiological parameters and comorbid depression in order to get information on how these potentially conflicting findings are linked together. Design: We used a quasi-experimental laboratory design which included multi-parametric physiological data collection of 40 panic subjects and 53 matched no-panic controls, as well as experimental induction of stress and relaxation over a time-course. Methods: Stress reactivity, interoceptive awareness (IAw; from the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ)) and IAc (as correlation between self-estimation and physiological data) were major outcome variables. Self-estimation of bioparametrical change was measured via numeric rating scales. Result: Panic subjects had stronger HR-reaction and more accurate HR-interoception. Concurrently, though, their IAc of skin conductance level, pulse amplitude and breathing amplitude was significantly lower than that of the control group. Interestingly, comorbid depression was found to be associated with increased IAw but attenuated IAc. Limitations: Demand characteristics and a categorical approach to panic confine the results. Conclusion: The potentially conflicting findings coalesce, as panic was associated with an increase of the ability to perceive the fear-related parameter and a simultaneous decrease of the ability to perceive other parameters.

"632","Does seeing an Asian face make speech sound more accented?","Prior studies have reported that seeing an Asian face makes American English sound more accented. The current study investigates whether this effect is perceptual, or if it instead occurs at a later decision stage. We first replicated the finding that showing static Asian and Caucasian faces can shift people’s reports about the accentedness of speech accompanying the pictures. When we changed the static pictures to dubbed videos, reducing the demand characteristics, the shift in reported accentedness largely disappeared. By including unambiguous items along with the original ambiguous items, we introduced a contrast bias and actually reversed the shift, with the Asian-face videos yielding lower judgments of accentedness than the Caucasian-face videos. By changing to a mixed rather than blocked design, so that the ethnicity of the videos varied from trial to trial, we eliminated the difference in accentedness rating. Finally, we tested participants’ perception of accented speech using the selective adaptation paradigm. After establishing that an auditory-only accented adaptor shifted the perception of how accented test words are, we found that no such adaptation effect occurred when the adapting sounds relied on visual information (Asian vs. Caucasian videos) to influence the accentedness of an ambiguous auditory adaptor. Collectively, the results demonstrate that visual information can affect the interpretation, but not the perception, of accented speech.

"633","Participation in job-related training in European countries: The impact of skill supply and demand characteristics","Ageing populations and accelerating economic change make it increasingly important to update the skill levels of populations over the whole life course. Adult education is believed to allow adults’ skills to adapt continuously to constantly changing economic requirements. Both research into adult education, and discussions on lifelong learning policies have been dominated by a supply side view of the labour market (the human capital approach), which has tended to underplay the role of the demand side of the labour market. This paper aims to extend previous analyses by examining how both labour supply and demand characteristics influence participation in non-formal job-related education in countries with different skill formation systems. The paper emphasises skill use at work. The purpose is to understand better the relationship between participation in adult education and workers’ skills profiles as well as the extent to which those skills are used in jobs and how this relationship differs in different countries. We used data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies and applied logistic regression analysis.

"634","Through babies’ eyes: Practical and theoretical considerations of using wearable technology to measure parent–infant behaviour from the mothers’ and infants’ view points","Aims: To explore the utility of first-person viewpoint cameras at home, for recording mother and infant behaviour, and for reducing problems associated with participant reactivity, which represent a fundamental bias in observational research. Methods: We compared footage recording the same play interactions from a traditional third-person point of view (3rd PC) and using cameras worn on headbands (first-person cameras [1st PCs]) to record first-person points of view of mother and infant simultaneously. In addition, we left the dyads alone with the 1st PCs for a number of days to record natural mother–child behaviour at home. Fifteen mothers with infants (3–12 months of age) provided a total of 14h of footage at home alone with the 1st PCs. Results: Codings of maternal behaviour from footage of the same scenario captured from 1st PCs and 3rd PCs showed high concordance (kappa &gt;0.8). Footage captured by the 1st PCs also showed strong inter-rater reliability (kappa = 0.9). Data from 1st PCs during sessions recorded alone at home captured more ‘negative’ maternal behaviours per min than observations using 1st PCs whilst a researcher was present (mean difference=0.90 (95% CI 0.5–1.2, p &lt; 0.001 representing 1.5 SDs). Conclusion: 1st PCs offer a number of practical advantages and can reliably record maternal and infant behaviour. This approach can also record a higher frequency of less socially desirable maternal behaviours. It is unclear whether this difference is due to lack of need of the presence of researcher or the increased duration of recordings. This finding is potentially important for research questions aiming to capture more ecologically valid behaviours and reduce demand characteristics.

"635","Distances on hills look farther than distances on flat ground: Evidence from converging measures","Distances on hills are judged as farther than when the same distance is presented on the flat ground. The hypothesized reason for this difference is because perception is influenced by the increased effort required to walk up a hill than to walk the same distance on flat ground. Alternatively, distances presented up a hill might be judged as farther for other, nonperceptual reasons such as bias from demand characteristics. To test whether distances on hills are perceived as farther or are merely judged as farther, we used a variety of measures, including visual matching and blindwalking tasks, and found similar effects across all measures. This convergence is consistent with a perceptual explanation. Second, we mined our data with the goal of making recommendations for future research on this paradigm. Although all of the perceptual measures used showed similar effects, visual matching was the only measure that had good intrasubject reliability. We recommend that future research on this action-specific effect could use any measure unless the research is geared towards individual differences, in which case, only the visual matching measure of perceived distance should be used.

"636","Do people hear a sarcastic tone of voice when silently reading sarcastic text?","The received wisdom is that people can mentally invoke a sarcastic tone of voice during silent reading although there is no direct evidence for this claim. We provide an empirical demonstration. In Study 1, participants silently read a set of ambiguous phrases as either being sarcastic or sincere, and chose from a set of adjectives those that best describe the tone of voice that was invoked. Sarcasm-discriminating and sincere-discriminating adjectives were identified. In Study 2, a different sample read a set of phrases in a minimal discourse context. The critical phrase (e.g., “ isn’t she friendly ”) was preceded by one of three contexts: positive (to invite a sincere reading), negative (to invite a sarcastic reading), and an ambiguous context that could invoke either a sincere or sarcastic reading. Following each scenario participants were asked to rate a set of adjectives as to the extent the adjective was mentally heard during silent reading: the adjectives were a subset of those that were sarcasm-discriminating, sincere-discriminating (as determined in Study 1) or a set of adjectives irrelevant to tone of voice. As predicted, even when not instructed to think sarcastically, participants rated most highly those adjectives chosen as associated with a sarcastic tone of voice in the negative context and least in the positive context. Analogously, the opposite effect was observed for sincere-discriminating items: rated as most applicable to what is being heard internally for positive contexts and rated lowest in negative contexts. These basic findings were replicated when demand characteristics were minimized (Study 3).

"637","#FeedTheDeed: An action teaching project for the psychology of prosocial behavior","Pedagogically, the author's goal of the #FeedTheDeed project is for students to personally experience the effect of prosocial behavior on happiness and to learn more about research methodology, while engaging in behaviors that promote and spread kindness to others. Students taking Social Psychology at Carlow University are nominated to #FeedTheDeed, which entails recording themselves performing a good deed, with the twist that they are randomly assigned to perform the good deed for a stranger or a friend or family member. Since the author designed the project as an experiment, the class discussion also serves as a forum for critically evaluating the methodology of the project as a scientific study. Students came up with such critiques as that the sample was small and biased, consisting of mostly female students with similar backgrounds; demand characteristics; and a reliance on self-report data. The class discussion further provided an opportunity for students to reflect on prosocial behaviors in general. Despite a few minor concerns, there are many benefits of using #FeedTheDeed as a class project. It's fun, it spreads kindness, and it's also highly rewarding for the instructor.

"638","Psychophysiological assessment of social stress in natural and laboratory situations: Using the experience sampling method and additional heart rate measures","Experience sampling and psychophysiological ambulant assessment methods were employed to compare reactions to social stress using a laboratory stressor (The Trier Social Stress Test [TSST]) or a corresponding real-life condition (seminar presentation). Stress reactions were assessed by self-report as well as additional heart rate (AHR, i.e., heart rate increases corrected for physical activity and initial values) and were compared to a control condition in each group. Twenty-five participants gave a talk in a university seminar course and twenty-two participants took part in the TSST. The TSST elicited a greater overall physiological stress reaction as compared to the seminar presentation. However, analyses of dynamic AHR levels revealed that the groups of speakers showed different response profiles during the time course of the stress situations. AHR levels of both groups were similar at the beginning of the free speech. During the course of their presentation, seminar speakers downregulated their arousal level. The arousal level of TSST participants showed a further increase in the later portion of the TSST during the mental arithmetic task. Thus, the more prominent overall physiological stress reaction during the TSST as compared to the seminar presentation appeared to depend on different demand characteristics rather than on differences of laboratory versus real-life situations per se. The experience of emotional strain was greater in response to the social stressors than in response to control situations in both the TSST and seminar speaker group with no differential effects of the experimental setting (laboratory vs. real life). During the TSST procedure, salivary cortisol concentrations were also assessed. Significant correlations of AHR with cortisol level and subjective experience indicate that AHR measurement provides a valid psychophysiological indicator of social stress. These findings suggest that ambulatory assessment techniques successfully contribute to the validation of a common social stress task.

"639","Automaticity and affective responses in valence transfer: Insights from the crossmodal auditory-visual paradigm","The current study examined valence transfer in the crossmodal paradigm in order to test the generalizability of the phenomenon and to contribute to a better understanding of the underlying processes. Western European participants evaluated Asian ideographs to be more visually pleasant when in the presence of pleasant sounds than when in the presence of neutral or unpleasant sounds (Experiment 1). Experiment 2 was conducted to reduce the demand characteristics, and to investigate the involvement of affective responses. We measured facial electromyography (EMG) and skin conductance responses (SCR) from participants evaluating ideographs while a piece of music was playing in the background. Evaluative judgments of the ideographs reflected subtle variance of valence within the piece of music. The extent of this valence transfer depended on the extent of SCRs within the respective trial. In addition, ideograph judgments were accompanied by concordant affective responses within facial EMG. The findings suggest that valence transfer from brief stimuli can be generalized to the crossmodal paradigm, occurs even if the experimental procedure obscures the purpose of investigation (i.e., automatically), and that affective responses are involved.

"640","The effect of self-focused attention and mood on appearance dissatisfaction after mirror-gazing: An experimental study","Background and objectives: Self-focused attention is hypothesized to be a maintenance factor in body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). The aim of this study was to use an experimental paradigm to test this hypothesis by studying the effect of self-focused attention during mirror-gazing on appearance dissatisfaction. Methods: An experimental group design was used, in which 173 women were randomly allocated to one of three conditions before mirror-gazing for 2 min: (a) external focus of attention, (b) self-focus of attention, and (c) self-focus of attention with a negative mood induction. Results: After mirror-gazing, participants across all groups rated themselves as being more dissatisfied with their appearance. In both the self-focus conditions, there was an increase in sadness from pre to post mirror gazing, and there was a significant difference in focus of attention for participants in the self-focused, mood-induced group from pre to post manipulation, suggesting mood induction had more of an effect than focus of attention. Limitations: (1) there was no condition involving an external focus with a negative mood induction, and (2) due to the level of information provided to patients on the nature of the task, we cannot rule out demand characteristics as an influencing factor on our results. Conclusions: Self-focused attention during mirror-gazing may act indirectly to increase appearance dissatisfaction via the effect of negative mood. Further studies are required to establish the relative contribution of self-focused attention and negative mood to increases in appearance dissatisfaction as a function of mirror-gazing.

"641","Effects of compassion meditation on a psychological model of charitable donation","Compassion is critical for societal wellbeing. Yet, it remains unclear how specific thoughts and feelings motivate compassionate behavior, and we lack a scientific understanding of how to effectively cultivate compassion. Here, we conducted 2 studies designed to a) develop a psychological model predicting compassionate behavior, and b) test this model as a mediator of a Compassion Meditation (CM) intervention and identify the “active ingredients” of CM. In Study 1, we developed a model predicting compassionate behavior, operationalized as real-money charitable donation, from a linear combination of self-reported tenderness, personal distress, perceived blamelessness, and perceived instrumental value of helping with high cross-validated accuracy, r = .67, p &lt; .0001. Perceived similarity to suffering others did not predict charitable donation when controlling for other feelings and attributions. In Study 2, a randomized controlled trial, we tested the Study 1 model as a mediator of CM and investigated active ingredients. We compared a smartphone-based CM program to 2 conditions—placebo oxytocin and a Familiarity intervention—to control for expectancy effects, demand characteristics, and familiarity effects. Relative to control conditions, CM increased charitable donations, and changes in the Study 1 model of feelings and attributions mediated this effect (pab = .002). The Familiarity intervention led to decreases in primary outcomes, while placebo oxytocin had no significant effects on primary outcomes. Overall, this work contributes a quantitative model of compassionate behavior, and informs our understanding of the change processes and intervention components of CM.

We show that, to account for different demand characteristics, the company adjusts the two main components governing the dynamics of posted fares, namely time (the number of days before departure) and capacity (the current number of available seats). We find that: 1) in routes with a strong presence of leisure (business) traffic, fares are set to be less (more) responsive to the time component; 2) in schedules more suitable for leisure (business) travellers, fares are set to be less (more) responsive to the capacity component.

"643","Beyond the more the merrier: The variety effect and consumer heterogeneity in system markets","Research in indirect network effects has simplistically treated complementary product variety as the total number of complementary products (e.g., game titles in video game markets). This assumption of equi-differentiation ignores differences across genres or product categories. Furthermore, since consumers with differential preferences for variety enter the market at different stages, consumer heterogeneity in preference for variety in complementary products may evolve as the market develops. We propose a model that recognizes these previously ignored, but important, demand characteristics, and empirically investigate the effects of breadth and depth of software variety on consumer hardware adoption in the fifth-generation video game market. We find that early adopters seek variety across a wide spectrum of game genres, and that late adopters are interested only in action-oriented games and have no interest in strategy-oriented games unless they are so-called “superstars.” Our findings imply that effective variety planning should be built along both dimensions, instead of simply assuming that more is better. Our policy simulations demonstrate that variety planning is as critical as entry timing to the success of platform companies in system competition, and is one of the reasons for PlayStation's winning the battle against Nintendo64. In addition, the boosting effect of a new title on hardware sales perishes quickly, so it is important to have a cascade strategy to guarantee a continuous supply of complementary software.

"644","Carrying a biological “backpack”: Quasi-experimental effects of weight status and body fat change on perceived steepness","The apparent steepness of hills and stairs is overestimated in explicit perception. These overestimations are malleable in that when physiological resources are compromised, apparent steepness is further overestimated. An alternative explanation of these experimental findings attributes them to demand characteristics. This article tests the relationship between estimated steepness and naturally occurring differences in body composition. A quasi-experimental field study revealed more exaggerated reports of staircase steepness in overweight than in healthy-weight participants in a situation where experimental demand would be an implausible explanation for any differences. A longitudinal follow-up study used dual X-ray absorptiometry to objectively measure participants’ body composition at the beginning and end of a weight-loss program (N = 52). At baseline, higher levels of body fat were associated with steeper explicit estimates of staircase steepness. At follow-up, changes in body fat were associated with changes in estimated steepness such that a loss of fat mass co-occurred with shallower estimates. Discussion focuses on the malleability of perceived steepness at an individual level and the implication of these findings for the debate surrounding “embodied” models of perception.

"645","Products and organizations, mirrors in a funhouse: Three essays on the mirroring hypothesis","Much of the contemporary management literature on modularity implicitly assumes that increased product modularity is associated with advantageous increases in organizational modularity. Known as the ""mirroring hypothesis,"" this postulated relationship is the basis of prescriptions in favor of increasingly modular product design, despite inconclusive empirical evidence. The three essays in this dissertation seek to advance the extant literature on the mirroring hypothesis in the following ways: Essay one presents a systematic review of this fragmented literature. Specifically, this review finds that the extant literature currently contains inconsistent interpretations of modularity, as well as inconsistent conceptualizations of mirroring. Thus, debates on the mirroring hypothesis often amount to unproductive arguments over different things. Essay two puts forth a theoretical framework to explore mirroring between product and organization at the within-firm level. The proposed theory maintains that mirroring is contingent on the level of architectural knowledge, which correlates with a set of observable constructs. Essay three empirically tests the proposition that mirroring between product and organization is also contingent on the demand characteristics of the target customers. Using a sample constructed from the computer systems integration industry, I found empirical support for the proposed demand-side contingencies on mirroring. Research on the mirroring hypothesis has made important contributions to our understanding of the interactions between technology and organization. However, the extant narratives of mirroring in fact encompass distinct causal mechanisms interacting across multiple units of analysis. As this dissertation research shows, the structural correspondence between product and organization is like mirrors in a funhouse -- there are many mirrors; and many of the mirrors are distorted.

"646","The influence of markets on the division of labor","Understanding the workings of the division of labor is a critical research goal for economists and strategy scholars alike. For economists, the division of labor is a distinguishing feature of capitalism and a primary driver of productivity gains in the economic system. For strategy scholars, who study heterogeneity in firm performance, the division of labor among firms is inherently intertwined with the identification of factors determining why some firms outperform others. Within this topical research stream, this dissertation comprises two studies examining how the division of labor is influenced by the supply side and the demand side of markets. In the first study, we examine the supply side. Using a formal model, we identify the firm resources that are precursory to integration, to taper integration, and to the division of labor. In the second study, we examine the demand side. We argue that demand characteristics such as market size and the heterogeneity of consumers' valuations impact the costs and benefits of the division of labor. We find empirical support for the theory from large-scale longitudinal data covering the real estate industry in Southeast Michigan.

"647","The alliance in psychiatric rehabilitation: Client characteristics associated with the initial alliance and the relationship of the initial alliance to outcomes in a supported employment program","The therapeutic alliance is widely recognized as an effective component of therapeutic change. However, the topic has received very little attention within the context of psychiatric rehabilitation programs. The limited evidence available suggests that the alliance may be related to client outcomes within psychiatric rehabilitation programs, but there is no evidence as to which factors are related to the alliance within this setting. This dissertation consists of two studies intended to contribute to the limited knowledge base concerning this key construct within psychiatric rehabilitation. Both studies used previously collected and de-identified data made available for analyses by a supported employment program, a type of psychiatric rehabilitation program. Data were made available for 70 individuals served by the single employment specialist in the program. All data were captured upon intake by program administrative processes in place at that time, or were extracted from program administrative databases (for outcomes). Study 1 examined whether client characteristics found to be associated with the alliance across several populations or program types were associated with the initial alliance upon intake to the program. Study 2 examined the relationship between the initial alliance and program and employment outcomes six months after intake into the program. The initial alliance was of interest due to a recognized link between the early alliance and program retention for individuals with schizophrenia, one of the primary target populations for psychiatric rehabilitation programs. Study 1 found being older at intake and having a smaller social network size were significantly correlated with client self-report of a high alliance at the bivariate level. A forward stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that neither variable remained an independent predictor of having a high alliance when controlling for the effects of the other. Study 2 found no significant relationships between a high initial alliance and program retention, amount of services received, or obtaining employment six months after intake through bivariate and linear or logistic forward stepwise regression analyses. These findings may have resulted from unexpectedly high alliance ratings, which limited the variability observed. The high ratings may have been clue to social demand characteristics associated with how the measure was administered, the limited length of the relationship on which to base the ratings, or other factors.

"648","A transdiagnostic treatment for emotion regulation: A new group therapy protocol combining exposure therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and dialectical behavioral therapy","This study was a quantitative outcome trial of an 8-week emotion regulation treatment protocol, which examined the effectiveness of a new treatment for emotion regulation combining Exposure Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). Emotion Dysegulation can be conceptualized as the full range of thoughts, feelings, somatic sensations and behavioral urges that originate as reactions and/or attempts to alter reactions to internal and external stimuli, which are contextually maladaptive in frequency, duration, intensity and/or expression. The sample for this study consisted of male and female clients, ( n = 22), recruited through a low-fee community mental health clinic and through local newspaper advertising. The study's two hypotheses were that this treatment would result in: 1) a decrease in the self-report of emotion dysregulation, an increase in emotional self-efficacy and a reduction in symptoms, and, 2) this treatment would result in a decrease in the self-report of experiential avoidance and distress intolerance. Results showed significant treatment differences and large effect sizes in pre-test to post-test measures of emotion dysregulation, as measured by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), emotional self-efficacy, as measured by the Multidimensional Negative Emotions Self-Regulatory Efficacy Scale (MNESRES) and depression, anxiety and stress, as measured by the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results also showed significant treatment differences and large effect sizes in pre-test to post-test measures of distress intolerance as measured by the Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS) and the Multidimensional Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire (MEAQ). These results provide strong support for both hypotheses, suggesting that this treatment is effective in reducing emotion dysregulation, decreasing experiential avoidance and decreasing distress intolerance. This study also offers support for the use of exposure to enhance skills training in a therapeutic setting. This study's limitations and confounds include a small sample size (n=22); differential baselines in participants; a lack of follow up on the data; therapist effects, reliance on self-report measures, practice effects, experimenter expectancy effects, and demand characteristics. Given the limitations, the results of this study should be interpreted with caution. Despite these limitations, the effect sizes suggest this treatment is effective for treating emotion dysregulation. Future research should further explore both the relationship and directionality between emotion dysregulation, experiential avoidance and distress intolerance.

"649","When the going gets tough the beautiful get going: Aesthetic appeal facilitates task performance","The current studies examined the effect of aesthetic appeal on performance. According to one hypothesis, appeal would lead to overall decrements or enhancements in performance [e.g. Sonderegger &amp; Sauer, ( Applied Ergonomics , 41 , 403–410, 2010)]. Alternatively, appeal might influence performance only in problem situations, such as when the task is difficult [e.g. Norman, (2004)]. The predictions of these hypotheses were examined in the context of an icon search-and-localisation task. Icons were used because they are well-defined stimuli and pervasive to modern everyday life. When search was made difficult using visually complex stimuli (Experiment 1), or abstract and unfamiliar stimuli (Experiment 2), icons that were appealing were found more quickly than their unappealing counterparts. These findings show that in a low-level visual processing task, with demand characteristics related to appeal eliminated, appeal can influence performance, especially under duress.

"650","Action video game players' visual search advantage extends to biologically relevant stimuli","Research investigating the effects of action video game experience on cognition has demonstrated a host of performance improvements on a variety of basic tasks. Given the prevailing evidence that these benefits result from efficient control of attentional processes, there has been growing interest in using action video games as a general tool to enhance everyday attentional control. However, to date, there is little evidence indicating that the benefits of action video game playing scale up to complex settings with socially meaningful stimuli—one of the fundamental components of our natural environment. The present experiment compared action video game player (AVGP) and non-video game player (NVGP) performance on an oculomotor capture task that presented participants with face stimuli. In addition, the expression of a distractor face was manipulated to assess if action video game experience modulated the effect of emotion. Results indicate that AVGPs experience less oculomotor capture than NVGPs; an effect that was not influenced by the emotional content depicted by distractor faces. It is noteworthy that this AVGP advantage emerged despite participants being unaware that the investigation had to do with video game playing, and participants being equivalent in their motivation and treatment of the task as a game. The results align with the notion that action video game experience is associated with superior attentional and oculomotor control, and provides evidence that these benefits can generalize to more complex and biologically relevant stimuli.

"651","Ironic effects as reflexive responses: Evidence from word frequency effects on involuntary subvocalizations","In ironic processing , one is more likely to think about something (e.g., white bears) when instructed to not think about that thing. To further investigate this phenomenon involving cognitive control, in the Reflexive Imagery Task (RIT), participants are instructed to not subvocalize the names of visual objects. On the majority of the trials, participants fail to suppress such subvocalizations. This finding supports theorizing that conscious thoughts can be triggered by external stimuli in a manner that is nontrivial, involuntary, and, importantly, reflex-like. These conclusions challenge intuitions that consciousness is unpredictable, whimsical, and somewhat insulated from external control. Perhaps these thoughts arise, not in a reflex-like manner, but from experimental demand or other high-level, strategic processes. This prevalent criticism would be inconsistent with the observation that the RIT effect is influenced by a stimulus parameter such as word frequency. Regarding demand characteristics, such an artifact would require participants to have a theory regarding how word frequency should influence responses. We introduce evidence that stimuli associated with high frequency names are more likely to yield involuntary subvocalizations than stimuli associated with low frequency names. These theoretically-relevant data suggest that ironic effects in paradigms such as the RIT resemble reflex-like processes.

"652","Predictors of human papillomavirus awareness and knowledge in 2013: Gaps and opportunities for targeted communication strategies","Background: Nearly 80 million people in the U.S. are currently infected with at least one of two strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), which is associated with 70% of cervical cancers. Greater cervical cancer mortality has been observed among women of lower SES and those living in rural, versus urban, areas. African American and Hispanic women are significantly more likely to die from cervical cancer than non-Hispanic white women. Purpose: To assess current population awareness of and knowledge about HPV and the HPV vaccine, as well as the contribution of sociodemographic characteristics to disparities in HPV awareness and knowledge. Methods: Cross-sectional data were obtained from the National Cancer Institute’s 2013 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS; N = 3,185). Multivariable logistic regression was employed to identify gaps in awareness and knowledge by sex, education, income, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and other important sociodemographic characteristics. Analyses were conducted in 2014. Results: Sixty-eight percent of Americans had heard of HPV and the HPV vaccine. Consistent with the Knowledge Gap Hypothesis, awareness and knowledge were patterned by sex, age, education, and other important sociodemographic factors. Those in rural areas were less likely than those in urban areas to know that HPV causes cervical cancer. Less than 5% of Americans were aware that HPV often clears on its own without treatment. Conclusions: Although awareness and knowledge of HPV is increasing, there are opportunities to target communication with populations for whom knowledge gaps currently exist, in order to promote dialogue about the vaccine among patients and their providers.

"653","<i>In situ</i> methodology for studying state driver stress: A between-subjects design replication","Previous studies of driver stress have utilized in-vehicle in situ questionnaires to measure driver stress during the actual commute. These studies demonstrated several important findings, but all adopted a repeated-measures research design where each participant was exposed to counterbalanced high and low congestion conditions. This approach reduced between-subjects variability but increased the possibility of demand characteristics. The current study replicated the findings of the in situ methodology using a between-subjects research design. State stress was greater in heavy traffic. Time urgency, lack of perceived control, and trait susceptibility to perceiving driving as stressful contributed to higher levels of state driver stress. No gender differences in state driver stress were found. Implications of the results and future research directions are discussed.

"654","Not by strength alone: Children’s conflict expectations follow the logic of the Asymmetric War of Attrition","The Asymmetric War of Attrition (AWA) model of animal conflict in evolutionary biology (Maynard Smith and Parker in Nature , 246, 15–18, 1976) suggests that an organism’s decision to withdraw from a conflict is the result of adaptations designed to integrate the expected value of winning, discounted by the expected costs that would be incurred by continuing to compete, via sensitivity to proximate cues of how quickly each side can impose costs on the other (Resource Holding Potential), and how much each side will gain by winning. The current studies examine whether human conflict expectations follow the formalized logic of this model. Children aged 6–8 years were presented with third-party conflict vignettes and were then asked to predict the likely winner. Cues of ownership, hunger, size, strength, and alliance strength were systematically varied across conditions. Results demonstrate that children’s expectations followed the logic of the AWA model, even in complex situations featuring multiple, competing cues, such that the actual relative costs and benefits that would accrue during such a conflict were reflected in children’s expectations. Control conditions show that these modifications to conflict expectations could not have resulted from more general experimental artifacts or demand characteristics. To test the selectivity of these effects to conflict, expectations of search effort were also assessed. As predicted, they yielded a different pattern of results. These studies represent one of the first experimental tests of the AWA model in humans and suggest that future research on the psychology of ownership, conflict, and value may be aided by formalized models from evolutionary biology.

"655","Nostalgia counteracts self-discontinuity and restores self-continuity","Nostalgia is a resource that functions, in part, as a response to self-discontinuity and a source of self-continuity. We tested and supported this regulatory role of nostalgia in the tradition of establishing a causal chain. In Study 1, we examined the naturalistic association between events precipitating self-discontinuity and nostalgia. Self-discontinuity, especially when stemming from negative life events, was associated with higher proneness to nostalgia. In Study 2, we experimentally induced negative self-discontinuity (i.e. relatively disruptive), positive self-discontinuity (i.e. relatively non-disruptive) or self-continuity (i.e. neutral non-disruptiveness) and subsequently assessed state levels of nostalgia. Only negative self-discontinuity evoked heightened nostalgia. In Study 3, we experimentally induced nostalgia (versus ordinary autobiographical recollection) and assessed self-continuity. Nostalgia augmented self-continuity. In Study 4, we experimentally induced nostalgia (versus ordinary autobiographical recollection versus positive autobiographical recollection) and assessed self-continuity. Again, nostalgia augmented self-continuity and did so above and beyond positive affect. Here, we ruled out demand characteristics as a rival hypothesis. Taken together, the findings clarify the role of nostalgia in the dynamic between self-discontinuity and self-continuity and elucidate the restorative properties of nostalgia for the self-system.

"656","Observer effects without demand characteristics: An inductive investigation of video monitoring and performance","Purpose: The purpose of these two studies was to explore the relationship between video monitoring and quantity of performance in the absence of demand characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: Data were gathered via two experiments involving business students working on a motor task. Participants were randomly assigned to the monitored and unmonitored conditions. Experiment 1 ( n = 75) was inductive while Experiment 2 ( n = 139) was partially inductive. Findings: Experiment 1 showed that monitored participants’ performance was lower than that of unmonitored participants. Further, monitoring reduced outliers, increased interquartile variance, and normalized the distribution. Experiment 2 replicated the effect of monitoring on performance controlling for cognitive ability and emotions, demonstrated that negative emotions interacted with monitoring condition, and suggested that differences in performance were not due to cheating or variation in task-related strategies. We offer a grounded theory of video monitoring proposing that different implicit decision rules are activated when people are monitored as compared to when they are not monitored. Implications: Future research needs to determine the extent to which our results extend to similar settings in the workplace and to other forms of observation. At this time, we believe organizations should carefully consider the consequences of electronic monitoring. Controlling expectations in the lab or workplace does not necessarily eliminate the independent effect of monitoring. Therefore, researchers must beware misinterpretation of effect sizes and overlooking the role of observation in their data. Originality/value: These studies demonstrate that video monitoring can create observer effects in the absence of demand characteristics. Our inductive approach revealed the nature of the effects beyond mean differences and served as the basis for developing a testable theory of monitoring that goes beyond what was previously known.

"657","Sizing up Helen: Nonviolent physical risk-taking enhances the envisioned bodily formidability of women","Men are more prone than women to both commit physical violence and engage in nonviolent activities entailing the risk of injury or death. The Crazy Bastard Hypothesis (FESSLER et al. 2014a) addresses this conjunction, arguing that nonviolent physical risk-taking communicates information about the actor’s agonistic formidability, as individuals who are indifferent to the possibility of harm are more likely to enter conflicts, and more difficult to repel, than those who are more sensitive to harm. Reflecting the use of bodily size in representations that summarize formidability, previous work demonstrates that risk-prone men are envisioned to be larger than are risk-averse men. Though less violent than men, particularly in highly competitive environments, women too sometimes benefit from engaging in violence. Correspondingly, observers should draw similar inferences regarding formidability when assessing physically risk-prone women. Results from both a large online experiment in the U.S. and a follow-up study using a modified dependent measure designed to reduce demand characteristics reveal that a woman described as risk-prone is envisioned to be larger – and thus more formidable—than is a woman described as risk-averse. Nonviolent physical risk-taking is thus available to women as an avenue for communicating formidability when it is advantageous to do so.

However, the standard attitude-attribution paradigm used by Forgas might contain demand characteristics, to which happy people might be especially susceptible. In addition, Goldenberg and Forgas (2012) showed that a happy mood decreased a form of the FAE.

"659","An informational pathway to the development of a contamination-related memory bias","Background and objectives: Following from previous research in which post-encoding suggestions of threat led to the development of a memory bias (in the presumed absence of an attentional bias; Senn &amp; Radomsky, 2012), we sought to examine whether the development of a similar threat-relevant memory bias could be fostered via a purely informational pathway. Methods: A vignette about a classroom interaction was read aloud to (n = 96) undergraduate participants who then completed a post-encoding recall test. Participants were told that the experimenter forgot to read the last sentence of the vignette, and were then randomly assigned either to the Threat condition, in which the additional statement indicated that a character in the vignette had a highly contagious flu, or to the No-Threat condition, in which the additional statement indicated that a character in the vignette had been accepted to graduate school. A second recall test was then administered. Results: Participants in the Threat condition (but not those in the No-Threat condition) demonstrated aproportionate memory bias in favor of threatening information. This bias was not evident at the initial recall test. Limitations: Time spent engaging in active recall was not assessed. Also, although the study was designed to minimize demand characteristics, it is possible that these played a role. Conclusions: An explicit memory bias for threat can be created through informational means alone, even when no threat was present at encoding. Results are discussed in terms of pathways to fear and of cognitive approaches to understanding and treating anxiety disorders.

"661","Data science in supply chain management: Data-related influences on demand planning","Data-driven decisions have become an important aspect of supply chain management. Demand planners are tasked with analyzing volumes of data that are being collected at a torrential pace from myriad sources in order to translate them into actionable business intelligence. In particular, demand volatilities and planning are vital for effective and efficient decisions. Yet, the accuracy of these metrics is dependent on the proper specification and parameterization of models and measurements. Thus, demand planners need to step away from a ""black box"" approach to supply chain data science. Utilizing paired weekly point-of-sale (POS) and order data collected at retail distribution centers, this dissertation attempts to resolve three conflicts in supply chain data science. First, a hierarchical linear model is used to empirically investigate the conflicting observation of the magnitude and prevalence of demand distortion in supply chains. Results corroborate with the theoretical literature and find that data aggregation obscure the true underlying magnitude of demand distortion while seasonality dampens it. Second, a quasi-experiment in forecasting is performed to analyze the effect of temporal aggregation on forecast accuracy using two different sources of demand signals. Results suggest that while temporal aggregation can be used to mitigate demand distortion's harmful effect on forecast accuracy in lieu of shared downstream demand signal, its overall effect is governed by the autocorrelation factor of the forecast input. Lastly, a demand forecast competition is used to investigate the complex interaction among demand distortion, signal and characteristics on seasonal forecasting model selection as well as accuracy. The third essay finds that demand distortion and demand characteristics are important drivers for both signal and model selection. In particular, contrary to conventional wisdom, the multiplicative seasonal model is often outperformed by the additive model. Altogether, this dissertation advances both theory and practice in data science in supply chain management by peeking into the ""black box"" to identify several levers that managers may control to improve demand planning. Having greater awareness over model and parameter specifications offers greater control over their influence on statistical outcomes and data-driven decisions (PsycInfo (2022) Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","N/A","N/A","0","2",NA,"Jin, Yao","2014","https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/data-science-supply-chain-management-related/docview/1526137175/se-2?accountid=14026","APA PsycInfo (2022)"
"662","Cognitive-behavioural therapy for schizophrenia in a forensic mental health setting","Purpose: The efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for schizophrenia in community and general psychiatric settings has been widely investigated and its practice recommended in primary and secondary care. In secure forensic mental health services the evidence is less established. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of group CBT for schizophrenia in a high secure hospital. Design/methodology/approach: In all, 27 male forensic patients completed a manualised CBT group and were compared on primary and secondary outcomes to patients receiving treatment as usual (TAU). Primary outcomes were positive and negative symptoms as measured by the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS). A secondary outcome was interpersonal functioning as measured by the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-64). Findings: CBT participants showed improvement on negative symptoms; affective flattening, alogia, anhedonia and avolition; in comparison to participants in TAU. CBT participants also showed reductions in delusions and hallucinations on the SAPS but not the PSYRATS. TAU participants improved on positive symptoms as measured by the PSYRATS. CBT participants showed reductions in overall interpersonal problems, and most notably in being socially inhibited and self-sacrificing. No iatrogenic effects of treatment were found; improvements in depression anxiety and stress were reported by group completers, which contrasted to experiences of the TAU group. Research limitations/implications: Absence of random allocation to CBP or TAU groups retains the risk of recruitment bias. Findings are preliminary given the sample size. Multiple outcome assessments increase risk of a type I error. Practical implications: CBT for schizophrenia can be effective with clients in secure forensic mental health settings. Improvements in negative symptoms and interpersonal functioning appear to be particular gains. Self-report measures might be subject to specific demand characteristics in such settings. Originality/value: The evaluation includes a comparator group in a high secure setting, which is typically absent in reported evidence for this population (Blackburn, 2004). The study also investigated changes in interpersonal functioning, which has previously been noted as an important but absent outcome in CBT for psychosis (Haddock et al., 2009). Iatrogenic outcomes were also considered in the evaluation to ensure no adverse effects were experienced from treatment.

"663","Angry thoughts and daily emotion logs: Validity of the Angry Cognitions Scale","The Angry Cognitions Scale (ACS; Martin and Dahlen in J Ration Emot Cogn Behav Therapy 25:155–173, 2007) was designed to measure six cognitive processes related to anger: misattributing causation, overgeneralizing, catastrophizing, demandingness, inflammatory labeling, and adaptive processes. Preliminary evidence on the reliability of the ACS has been positive, demonstrating that the ACS is correlated with the experience and expression of anger, anger consequences, hostile thoughts, and responses to provocation (Martin and Dahlen in J Ration Emot Cogn Behav Therapy 25:155–173, 2007; J Ration Emot Cogn Behav Therapy, 29:65–76, 2011). This previous research, however, has suffered from limitations associated with demand characteristics and the reliance on retrospective data. The current study sought to address these limitations by using daily emotion logs. Results showed that the ACS predicted the daily experience of anger and anger related consequences, contributing to the literature on the ACS as a valuable measure of anger-related cognitions.

"664","Time-course of the DSM-5 cannabis withdrawal symptoms in poly-substance abusers","Background: Evidence is accumulating that a cannabis withdrawal syndrome is common, of clinical significance, and has a clear time course. Up till now, very limited data exist on the cannabis withdrawal symptoms in patients with co-morbid substance use disorders, other than cannabis use and tobacco use. Methods: Symptoms of withdrawal were assessed through patient self-reports during detoxification in Danish residential rehabilitation centers. Patients (n = 90) completed booklets three times during their first month at the treatment center. Self-reported withdrawal symptoms was rated using the DSM-5 Withdrawal Symptom Check List with withdrawal symptoms from all classes of substances, with no indication that the described symptoms should be attributed to withdrawal. Self-reported time since last use of cannabis was used as a predictor of cannabis withdrawal severity. Results: With the exception of loss of appetite, time since last use of cannabis was associated with all types of withdrawal symptoms listed in the DSM-5. Only four of 19 symptoms intended to measure withdrawal from other substances were related to time since last use of cannabis, including vivid, unpleasant dreams. Conclusions: The findings yield strong support to the notion of a cannabis withdrawal syndrome, and gives further evidence for the inclusion of the criterion of vivid, unpleasant dreams. Further, the findings speak against the significance of demand characteristics in determining the course of the symptoms of cannabis withdrawal.

The study utilized a design in which individuals were confronted with a person in pain in an ecologically valid setting. The authors utilized two separate meditation protocols both to enhance generalizability and to ensure that any resulting effects of meditation on behavior could not be attributed to demand characteristics. Following 8 weeks of meditation practice or approximately 8 weeks after initial recruitment to the waiting list, participants were scheduled to come to the lab under the guise of completing tests of cognitive ability. To assess compassionate responding, the authors measured the waiting room interactions of the participants with confederates. As predicted, meditation directly enhanced compassionate responding.

"666","Feedback-based alcohol interventions for mandated students: An effectiveness study of three modalities","The present study used a randomized clinical trial design to examine the effectiveness of personalized alcohol feedback delivered individually, in a group and via computer on alcohol use and related negative consequences in a sample of 173 college students referred for alcohol-related violations. Findings revealed statistically significant reductions in alcohol use and related harms for the individually delivered intervention, with significant reductions in alcohol-related harms for the electronically delivered intervention. No statistically significant results were found for the group-delivered intervention or between groups, and a main effect of time was noted for all outcome variables. This study adds to the literature by being the first randomized clinical trial to include analyses of an empirically supported individually delivered personalized alcohol feedback intervention with more cost-effective group-delivered and electronically delivered feedback formats within a single research design, by expanding the range of participant drinking habits reported at baseline to include all drinking levels and not solely those classified as ‘heavy drinking’ and by providing anonymity pre-intervention and post-intervention given the potential demand characteristics to underreport illegal and/or illicit behaviours in this vulnerable population.

"667","Positive fantasies or negative contrasts: The effect of media body ideals on restrained eaters’ mood, weight satisfaction, and food intake","Although viewing media body ideals promotes body dissatisfaction and problematic eating among women (e.g., extreme restraint/overeating), some argue that women only report such negative effects because they think that they are meant to (i.e., demand characteristics). Because restrained eaters are trying to lose weight, they might be vulnerable to such media exposure. However, because of demand characteristics, evidence is mixed. Therefore, we minimized demand characteristics and explored whether media body ideals would trigger restrained eaters to report negative (negative mood, weight dissatisfaction) or positive (positive mood, weight satisfaction) effects. We also hypothesized that this change (negative or positive) would encourage food intake. Restrained and unrestrained eaters ( n = 107) memorized media or control images. Restrained eaters exposed to media images reported decreased weight satisfaction and increased negative mood, but their food intake was not significantly affected. Perhaps paying advertent attention to the images caused goal-related negative affect, which triggered restraint.

"668","Compared to a small, supervised lab experiment, a large, unsupervised web-based experiment on a previously unknown effect has benefits that outweigh its potential costs","Research on internet-based studies has generally supported their benefits. However, that research sometimes did not directly compare internet-based to traditional delivery, often used non-experimental methods and small samples, and has not used an entirely unknown effect for the comparison to completely rule out demand characteristics. Our lab experiment ( N = 180), in which participants were supervised by an experimenter, demonstrated previously unexamined effects. Both the frighteningness and disgustingness of insects made people want to kill them, and females wanted to kill the insects more than males did. There were also some interesting patterns of interaction with gender, but they were not statistically significant. However, an unsupervised, but larger, web-based experiment ( N = 1301) produced the same significant main effects as the lab study, and the same patterns of inter action that had occurred at a nonsignificant level in the lab study occurred at a statistically significant level in the web-based study. These results add support to the finding that although web-based studies may incur risks by being unsupervised, such as some participants not being genuinely motivated to follow the instructions correctly, the risks are compensated for by the much larger sample size afforded by the web-based approach.

"670","Heart rate variability biofeedback in the treatment of major depression","Major depressive disorder is the most common mood disorder and is one of the most burdensome and disabling diseases in the world. Prevailing approaches to treating depression have a number of significant limitations and drawbacks. Consequently, alternative and adjunctive treatments for depression are being increasingly explored. The role of autonomic nervous system functioning in the etiology of depression has been examined, and depression has been found to be associated with sympathetic predominance and parasympathetic impairment. This decreased parasympathetic modulation has been attributed to impaired activity of the vagus nerve, as indexed by attenuated heart rate variability (HRV) at the respiratory frequency. Areas of the brain that are involved in emotion regulation influence vagus nerve functioning. HRV biofeedback has been shown to be a modality through which individuals can learn to increase the amplitude of their HRV oscillations by breathing at specific rates. Through HRV biofeedback, the vagus nerve is thought to be stimulated in such a way that promotes autonomic balance and improved emotion regulation. Previous research suggests that HRV biofeedback may significantly reduce depression symptoms. The current study was a preliminary efficacy, randomized controlled trial that intended to follow-up an open label pilot study previously conducted by this lab, which found HRV biofeedback to be effective at significantly reducing depressive symptoms. The primary goal was to evaluate the efficacy of a HRV biofeedback protocol by comparing it to a sham control protocol with similar demand characteristics. The study also sought to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability and effectiveness of this placebo. Eleven participants were recruited from the UMDNJ-University Behavioral Health Care population and surrounding communities, and were randomized to a treatment group, receiving ten weeks of HRV biofeedback training and home practice, or a control group, receiving ten weeks of sham respiratory biofeedback training and home practice. Primary outcome measures were the HAMD and the BDI-II—assessed at baseline, week four, week seven, and week ten. Results indicated no significant differences in depression symptom improvement between groups, although significant main effects for time were observed for both groups ( p &lt;.05). Results did, however, support the utility, feasibility, and tolerability of the credible sham respiratory control protocol.

"671","On EMDR: Eye movements during retrieval reduce subjective vividness and objective memory accessibility during future recall","In eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), patients make eye movements (EM) during trauma recall. Earlier experimental studies found that EM during recall reduces memory vividness during future recalls, and this was taken as laboratory support for the underlying mechanism of EMDR. However, reduced vividness was assessed with self-reports that may be affected by demand characteristics. We tested whether recall+EM also reduces memory vividness on a behavioural reaction time (RT) task. Undergraduates ( N = 32) encoded two pictures, recalled them, and rated their vividness. In the EM group, one of the pictures was recalled again while making EM. In the no-EM group one of the pictures was recalled without EM. Then fragments from both the recalled and non-recalled pictures, and new fragments were presented and participants rated whether these were (or were not) seen before. Both pictures were rated again for vividness. In the EM group, self-rated vividness of the recalled+EM picture decreased, relative to the non-recalled picture. In the no-EM group there was no difference between the recalled versus non-recalled picture. The RT task showed the same pattern. Reduction of memory vividness due to recall+EM is also evident from non-self-report data.

"672","Price discrimination by day-of-week of purchase: Evidence from the U. S. airline industry","This paper identifies a source of price discrimination utilized by airlines – price discrimination based on the day-of-the-week that a ticket is purchased . Using unique transaction data, we compare tickets on the same airline and route that are purchased on different days of the week, after controlling for the day of week of travel, the ticket restrictions, the demand characteristics of the flights, and the number of days in advance that the ticket is purchased. We find that fares are 5% lower when purchased on the weekend. We conjecture that this is a form of price discrimination. If airlines believe that weekend purchasers are more likely to be price-elastic leisure travelers, then they may offer lower prices on weekends when the mix of purchasing customers makes demand more price elastic. This conjecture is supported by the finding that the weekend purchase effect is distinctly larger on routes with a mixture of both business and leisure customers than on routes that disproportionately serve leisure customers. We illustrate that this pricing practice can have important impacts on airline profits. These results have implications for other industries that have the ability to change prices daily based upon the types of customers who purchase on a specific day.

"673","Factors influencing university students’ explicit and implicit sexual double standards","Quantitative research has resulted in inconsistent evidence for the existence of a sexual double standard, leading Crawford and Popp (2003) to issue a call for methodological innovation. The Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, &amp; Schwartz, 1998) is a measure that may provide a means to examine the double standard without the contamination of the demand characteristics and social desirability biases that plague self-report research (Marks &amp; Fraley, 2005). The purpose of this study was to examine the factors influencing explicit and implicit double standards, and to examine the relationship between these explicit and implicit double standards, and levels of socially desirable responding. One hundred and three university students completed a sexual double standard IAT, an explicit measure of the double standard, and measures of socially desirable responding. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that levels of socially desirable responding were not related to implicit or explicit double standards. Men endorsed a stronger explicit traditional double standard than women, whereas for implicit sexual standards, men demonstrated a relatively gender-neutral evaluation and women demonstrated a strong reverse double standard. These results suggest the existence of a complex double standard, and indicate that more research of sexual attitudes should include implicit measures.

"674","On the prevalence of directly retrieved autobiographical memories","In this study, we used process measures to understand how people recall autobiographical memories in response to different word cues. In Experiment 1, participants provided verbal protocols when cued by object and emotion words. Participants also reported whether memories had come directly to mind. The self-reports and independent ratings of the verbal protocols indicated that directly recalled memories are much faster and more frequent than generated memories and are more prevalent when cued by objects than emotions. Experiment 2 replicated these results without protocols to eliminate any demand characteristics or output interference associated with the protocol method. In Experiment 3, we obtained converging results using a different method for assessing retrieval strategies by asking participants to assess the amount of information required to retrieve memories. The greater proportion of fast direct retrievals when memories are cued by objects accounts for reaction time differences between object and emotion cues, and not the commonly accepted explanation based on ease of retrieval. We argue for a dual-strategies approach that disputes generation as the canonical form of autobiographical memory retrieval and discuss the implication of these findings for the representation of personal events in autobiographical memory.

"675","Unmasking the Perky effect: Spatial extent of image interference on visual acuity","We have previously argued that visual mental images are not substitutable for visual percepts, because the interfering effects of visual stimuli such as line maskers on visual targets differ markedly in their properties from the interfering effects of visual images (the “Perky effect”). Imagery interference occurs over a much wider temporal and spatial extent than masking, and unlike masking, image interference is insensitive to relative orientation. The lack of substitutability is theoretically interesting because the Perky effect can be compared meaningfully to real line masking in that both types of interference are visual, not due to optical factors (accommodative blur or poor fixation) or to high-level factors (attentional distraction, demand characteristics, or effects of uncertainty). In this report, however, we question our earlier position that spatial extents of interference are markedly different: when images and real lines are matched in contrast, which was not done previously, their interference effects have very similar spatial extents. These data add weight to the view that spatial properties of images and percepts are similar in respect to extent. Along with the wider temporal extent and the insensitivity to orientation, the new results remain compatible with our older hypothesis that to create a clear mental image in a region of visual space, incoming signals from the eye must be suppressed (Craver-Lemley and Reeves, 1992). We have pursued this idea in this report using “unmasking,” in which adding elements to the visual image in the region beyond the zone of suppression reduces the Perky effect.

"676","Love of money and unethical behavior intention: Does an authentic supervisor’s personal integrity and character (ASPIRE) make a difference?","We investigate the extent to which perceptions of the authenticity of supervisor’s personal integrity and character (ASPIRE) moderate the relationship between people’s love of money (LOM) and propensity to engage in unethical behavior (PUB) among 266 part-time employees who were also business students in a five-wave panel study. We found that a high level of ASPIRE perceptions was related to high love-of-money orientation, high self-esteem, but low unethical behavior intention (PUB). Unethical behavior intention (PUB) was significantly correlated with their high Machiavellianism, low self-esteem, and low intrinsic religiosity. Our counterintuitive results revealed that the main effect of LOM on PUB was not significant, but the main effect of ASPIRE on PUB was significant. Further, the significant interaction effect between LOM and ASPIRE on unethical behavior intention provided profoundly interesting findings: High LOM was related to high unethical behavior intention for people with low ASPIRE, but was related to low unethical intention for those with high ASPIRE. People with high LOM and low ASPIRE had the highest unethical behavior intention; whereas those with high LOM and high ASPIRE had the lowest. We discuss results in light of individual differences, ethical environment, and perceived demand characteristics.

A person–situation approach was taken to understand the individual differences and job demand characteristics that help explain the relationship between polychronicity and job performance. Hypotheses were tested with two samples of employees in different organizations ( N =222 and 168, respectively). Results provide support for polychronicity as a predictor of job performance and a correlate of other individual differences measures (e.g., personality, job-relevant skills). In addition, polychronicity accounted for variance in job performance beyond personality, biodata, and ability. Results are discussed in the context of future research and applications for identifying contexts in which polychronicity is a salient predictor.

"678","Hidden conflicts: Explanations make inconsistencies harder to detect","A rational response to an inconsistent set of propositions is to revise it in a minimal way to restore consistency. A more important psychological goal is usually to create an explanation that resolves the inconsistency. We report five studies showing that once individuals have done so, they find inconsistencies harder to detect. Experiment 1 established the effect when participants explained inconsistencies, and Experiment 2 eliminated the possibility that the effect was a result of demand characteristics. Experiments 3a and 3b replicated the result, and showed that it did not occur in control groups that evaluated (or justified) which events in the pairs of assertions were more surprising. Experiment 4 replicated the previous findings, but the participants carried out all the conditions acting as their own controls. In all five studies, control conditions established that participants were able to detect comparable inconsistencies. Their explanations led them to reinterpret the generalizations as holding by default, and so they were less likely to treat the pairs of assertions as inconsistent. Explanations can accordingly undo the devastating consequences of logical inconsistencies, but at the cost of a subsequent failure to detect them.

Four experiments are presented examining the role of self-esteem in the misinformation effect and whether enhanced suggestibility effects in participants low in self-esteem reflect genuine memory impairment. In Experiments 1 and 4 participants completed a standard recognition test. In Experiment 2 participants completed the modified recognition test.

The findings suggest that participants low in self-esteem are particularly sensitive to demand characteristics and post-event suggestion but do not suffer from genuine memory impairment.

"681","Aesthetic preference for spatial composition in multiobject pictures","Five experiments examined preferences for horizontal positions in multiobject pictures. In Experiment 1, each picture contained a fixed object and an object whose position could be adjusted to create the most (or least) aesthetically pleasing image. Observers placed the movable object closer to the fixed object when the objects were related than when they were unrelated (a relatedness bias) but almost never overlapped them (a separation bias). Experiment 2 showed that these results were not due to demand characteristics by replicating them almost exactly in a between-participants design. In Experiment 3, preference rankings revealed a strong relatedness bias together with an inward bias toward the spatial envelope of objects to point into the frame. A weak balance effect was evident in a multiple regression analysis. Experiment 4 replicated the inward bias for the spatial envelope using multiobject groups. Experiment 5 generalized the above findings for different objects when observers had to choose between image pairs that differed only in interobject distance or degree of balance. Strong relatedness effects were again present, but there was no evidence of any preference for balance.

"682","Forecasting good or bad behaviour: A non-transparent test of contrastive responses to cultural cues","Bicultural individuals vary in the degree to which their two cultural identities are integrated—Bicultural Identity Integration (BII). Among Asian-Americans, for example, some experience their Asian and American sides as integrated (high BII) whereas others experience the two as divided (low BII). Past research on social judgement found that individual differences in BII affect the way biculturals respond to cultural cues or norms in their situation. Asian-Americans with low BII tend to contrast to the cultural norm (e.g. they exhibit typically American judgements when in Asian cultural situations) rather than assimilate to them, a response observed more among high BII individuals (e.g., they exhibit typically Asian judgements when in Asian cultural situations). Research has interpreted the contrastive response as reflecting implicit identity motives, yet past studies used measures that make cultural differences salient. Conscious awareness of the experimental hypothesis could elicit contrastive responses. The present research assessed forecasts of others’ behaviour in which cultural group differences are less obvious: Asians, compared to Westerners, forecast more positive behaviours from others. In three experiments with Asian-Americans, we found the contrastive response by low BII individuals persisted. They made more positive forecasts after exposure to American versus Asian cultural cues. This suggests that the moderating role of BII on responses to cultural cues is not a matter of demand characteristics or limited to stereotypical cultural differences. Implications for bicultural identity, implicit processes, and organizational behaviour are discussed.

"683","Perception of free will: The perspective of incarcerated adolescent and adult offenders","The existence of free will has been both an enduring presumption of Western culture and a subject for debate across disciplines for millennia. However, little empirical evidence exists to support the almost unquestioned assumption that, in general, Westerners endorse the existence of free will. The few studies that measure belief in free will have methodological problems that likely resulted in underestimating the true extent of belief. Recently, Rakos et al. (Behavior and Social Issues 17:20–39, 2008) found a stronger endorsement of free will when demand characteristics were eliminated. The current study builds on this work by sampling incarcerated adolescents and adults, whose freedom to act is externally constrained. Belief in free will as well as attitudes toward punishment, self-esteem, and locus of control were measured. The results indicate that free will is strongly endorsed in Western society even when freedom to act is severely restricted. However, incarcerated adolescents endorsed free will to a slightly lesser extent than their nonincarcerated counterparts from Rakos et al. (Behavior and Social Issues 17:20–39, 2008), while incarcerated and nonincarcerated adults offered equally strong endorsements. The comparable endorsement by adults is consistent with the hypothesis that the belief in agency is an evolutionary adaptation. The small decrease found for incarcerated adolescents may reflect the interaction between developmental factors and the expression of an evolutionary adaptation. Additionally, incarcerated adolescents and adults associated beliefs in free will with viewing punishment as a means of deterrence, rehabilitation, and retribution. Incarcerated adults, but not incarcerated adolescents, associated beliefs in free will with greater self-esteem and with an external locus of control. Finally, though both incarcerated adults and adolescents endorsed free will strongly, the former manifested the belief by emphasizing free agentic choice whereas the latter focused on the personal responsibility that is interwoven with free choice. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of evolutionary, cultural, and developmental factors.

"684","Type-based associations in grapheme-color synaesthesia revealed by response time distribution analyses","Determining the nature of binding in grapheme-color synaesthesia has consequences for understanding the neural basis of synaesthesia and visual awareness in general. We evaluated type- and token-based letter-color binding using a synaesthetic version of the object-reviewing paradigm. Although mean response times failed to reveal any significant differences between synaesthetes and control participants, RT analyses with ex-Gaussian distributions revealed that the response facilitation in the synaesthesia group reflected type representations exclusively, while response facilitation in the control group, who learned letter-color associations, was dominated by token representations. Thus, letter-color associations in associator synaesthetes are type-based, and do not involve binding to object tokens, consistent with their subjective reports. Contrary to recent studies that failed to find differences between synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes with behavioral measures, response time distribution analyses indicate that color sensations in synaesthetes are not simply the extreme form of normal letter-color associations, and cannot be attributed to demand characteristics.

"685","Scaling the information processing demands of occupations","The purpose of this study was to provide additional validity evidence for a model of person– environment fit based on polychronicity, stimulus load, and information processing capacities. In this line of research the confluence of polychronicity and information processing (e.g., the ability of individuals to process stimuli from the environment along five dimensions of information load, interpersonal load, change load, time structure, and activity structure) is applied to the occupational environment. Using magnitude estimation scaling, college students in the United States and Portugal rated 42 occupations across five information processing demand characteristics. Results indicated that occupations could be differentiated by the information load conditions, thus producing a profile of information processing demand characteristics unique to each of the occupations tested. Additional findings provided evidence for the validity of the scaled occupational values; ratings differed reliably across Holland categories, were fairly consistent across the two cultural groups, and showed expected relationships with salary and educational level.

"686","Dream incorporation of video-game play as a function of interactivity and fidelity","Video-game play offers the opportunity to investigate the continuity hypothesis. Using interactive video games rather than passive films as a controlled manipulation allows for an engaging presleep experience. Several researchers have successfully used video games to investigate dream incorporation. In this study, interactivity and fidelity were the independent measures that manipulated immersion in a commercially available video game. Interactivity was either passive or active, whereas fidelity was high-screen resolution and stereophonic headset audio versus low. The highest dream incorporation in the high-fidelity–high-interactivity condition was expected. Incorporation was assessed by participant self-report and judges' evaluations. The independent variable of fidelity was especially strong in both the manipulation and the subsequent dream incorporation for self-report. Interactivity became the dominant variable when viewed from the judges' perspectives. The effects of demand characteristics and emotionality were also considered.

"687","High- and low-level dissonance-based eating disorder prevention programs with young women with body image concerns: An experimental trial","Objective: As cognitive dissonance is theorized to contribute to the effects of dissonance-based eating disorder prevention programs, we evaluated a high-dissonance version of this program against a low-dissonance version and a wait-list control condition to provide an experimental test of the mechanism of intervention effects. Method: Female college students (N = 124, mean age = 20.9 years, SD = 3.9) with body image concerns were randomized to the 3 conditions. The high-dissonance program was designed to maximize dissonance induction, and the low-dissonance program was designed to minimize it; the substantive content of the 2 programs was matched. Results: Relative to controls, those in the high-dissonance condition showed significantly greater reductions in thin-ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, dieting, and eating disorder symptoms by posttest, and those in the low-dissonance condition showed significantly greater reductions in the first 3 outcomes by posttest, with most of these effects persisting to 3-month follow-up. High-dissonance participants showed significantly greater reductions in eating disorder symptoms than low-dissonance participants did by posttest, but this effect was nonsignificant by 3-month follow-up. Conclusions: Results suggest that dissonance induction contributes to intervention effects but imply that the intervention content, nonspecific factors, and demand characteristics play a much more potent role in producing effects.

"688","Operational flexibilities, risk sharing contracts, and sourcing strategies","This dissertation is composed of three chapters, studying operational flexibilities, risking sharing contracts, and firms' sourcing strategies. Chapter 1 investigates the interconnection among multiple-stage decisions of the oil refining process: crude procurement (mix of crude oils and quantity), intermediate processing (conversion from heavy to light fraction), and blending decisions. The emphasis is to understand how those decisions are affected by conditions of input and output market conditions and the refinery's processing capability, especially its two types of operational flexibility, namely, crude oil mixing in crude procurement and conversion of heavy (low-quality) fraction to light (high-quality) fraction in refining. We offer insights on the impact of market conditions on the values of conversion and mixing flexibility. Chapter 2 studies two prevailing types of contracts used in the semiconductor industry for horizontal capacity coordination between an IDM (integrated device manufacturer) and a foundry: a-contracts (or fixed commitment contracts) and capacity reservation contracts. Due to different nature of incentives under these contracts, it is not clear which type of contract performs better from the IDM's perspective. We show the sourcing and capacity decisions the IDM should make under different circumstances of cost and contract structure and demand characteristics, and demonstrates complexity of sourcing decisions in horizontal capacity coordination. The relationships between the two types of contracts are also investigated. Chapter 3 studies the tradeoff between sourcing cost and lead time in a competitive setting. Specifically, it studies a sourcing game where each firm may either source from a fast supplier with high cost or a slow supplier with low cost. With a fast supplier, the player can gather better demand information when making its quantity decision. We characterize the equilibrium of such a game and derive some managerial insights that may help explain the recent trend of backshoring in the U.S. (PsycInfo (2022) Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","N/A","N/A","0","2",NA,"Wu, Xiaole","2011","https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/operational-flexibilities-risk-sharing-contracts/docview/921295714/se-2?accountid=14026","APA PsycInfo (2022)"
"689","Throwing the baby out with the bathwater: When can we trust self-report outcome assessment from inpatient SMI?","Reliability of self-report outcome assessment is often called into question with the severely mentally ill population. In the context of inpatient care, demand characteristics may further complicate self-report measures. Although clinician-completed outcome measures, such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Expanded Version (BPRS-E), have become industry standard with this population, self-report assessment may be useful under certain conditions. This study sought to explore the relationship between a clinician-completed, the BPRS-E, and a self-completed measure, the SOQ, within the SMI inpatient population. A total of 357 adult participants with a minimum of three assessment iterations were analyzed. The results of the analysis indicated both measures correlated at all assessment iterations (admission, 90-, 180-, 270-, 360+ days), but when divided into SOQ admission clinical and subclinical groups only the clinical group maintained the correlation at all points. A logistical regression analysis indicated that membership in the subclinical group can be predicted by one subscale (Mood Disturbance) and three items (Hallucinations, Uncooperativeness, and Conceptual Disorganization) from the BPRS-E. The change trajectories of both measures were essentially identical; however, when divided into SOQ admission clinical and subclinical scores the SOQ and BPRS-E change trajectories were significantly different from each other and clinical versus subclinical on the same measure were significantly different. Further examination of the subclinical SOQ group revealed two distinct groups, scores that eventually had reliable change and exceeded the cutoff score and those that never did. A logistical regression analyses revealed that membership in these two groups can be reliably predicted by two BPRS-E items (Somatic Concerns and Suspiciousness), in that as each item increases the likelihood of membership in the group that never exceeds the cutoff score also increases. These results suggest that although the SMI inpatient population present with profound limitations, it may be possible to predict those who will eventually provide reliable self-report outcome assessments and those who will not. Although further research is necessary, these results are promising and may provide decision points for clinicians on when and when not to trust self-report outcome assessment with the SMI inpatient population.

"690","Aesthetic preferences in the size of images of real-world objects","Konkle and Oliva (in press, Journal of Experimental Psychology . Human Perception and Performance ) found that the preferred ('canonical') visual size of a picture of an object within a frame is proportional to the logarithm of its known physical size. They used within-participants designs on several tasks, including having participants adjust the object's size to 'look best'. We examined visual size preference in 2AFC tasks with explicit aesthetic instructions to choose: ""which of each pair you like best"". We also used both within- and between-participants conditions to investigate the possible role of demand characteristics. In experiments 1 and 2, participants saw all possible image pairs depicting the same object at six different sizes for twelve real-world objects that varied in physical size. Significant effects of known physical size were present, regardless of whether participants made judgments about a single object (the between-participants design) or about all objects intermixed (the within-participants design). Experiment 3 showed a reduced effect when the amount of image detail present at different visual sizes was kept constant by posterizing the images. The results are discussed in terms of ecological biases on aesthetic preferences.

"691","An investigation of verbal events as motivating operations: The effects of mood induction on the reinforcing value of consequences","This experimental study aimed to show the motivational effect of mood-altering verbal events on consequential functions through use of a within-subjects, repeated-measures design. Specifically, the effects of mood-induction on the self-reported value of various activities were investigated using explicit and implicit measurement. The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) was used as an indirect measure of changes in the reinforcing value of pleasant and unpleasant cognitive activities after mood induction. Implicit assessment allowed for minimization of demand characteristics together with assessment of cognitive preferences that participants were unaware of or reluctant to report. Data from 30 university undergraduates were analyzed and predicted effects regarding the differential reinforcement value of pleasant and unpleasant overt and covert activities after positive and negative mood induction were demonstrated. Pleasant activities were more reinforcing after positive mood induction and less reinforcing after negative mood induction, when unpleasant activities increased in reinforcing value. Interestingly, participants’ explicit report of mood state was often incongruent with their explicit and implicit preferences for overt and covert activities. Specifically, many participants did not explicitly report a negative affective state after negative mood-induction procedures, but they nonetheless preferred pleasant activities less. The reinforcing value of pleasant and unpleasant activities changed regardless of the mood state reported, based on contact with verbal environmental events. Altogether, these findings support the claim that verbal mood-altering antecedent events can function to alter the reinforcing value of activities, thus contributing to existing evidence that they function as motivating operations. Additionally, this study underscores the importance of implicit assessment, and highlights the potential utility of the IRAP as a clinical tool.

"692","Essays on consumer promotion timing expectations and promotional response and manufacturer's sales promotion decisions","Forward-looking behavior of consumers is important for modeling consumer response to promotions of frequently purchased consumer products as well as manufacturer’s optimal promotion schedule. The first essay studies consumer’s promotion timing expectations and promotion response. In previous studies, consumers’ price promotion expectations have been modeled using a first-order Markov (FOM) process. However, theoretical analyses and empirical evidence of the timing of promotions suggest that price promotions occur in cycles whose periodicity is stochastic. If promotions are cyclical, consumer expectations can be expected to incorporate this cyclicality. Therefore, in contrast to previous studies, we utilize a Proportional Hazard model (PHM) to characterize consumers’ expectation of future price promotion. Consumers are assumed to incorporate their expectations consistent with this model into their dynamic brand and quantity choices. Using scanner panel data from the canned tuna category, we first empirically show that the PHM fits the price promotion incidence data better. Second, our estimation results indicate that a structural model employing a PHM specification for promotion expectations fits the data better than one that assumes only a FOM price promotion expectation. Third, we show that promotion elasticities are overestimated by a structural model that assumes only a FOM promotion expectation. Fourth, we show using an analysis of promotion policy changes that a structural model with a FOM expectation can lead to suboptimal managerial decisions. Lastly, we consider policy simulations in which consumers learn about policy change in a Bayesian fashion. The second essay investigates a manufacturer’s optimal timing and depth of price promotions over a planning horizon in a frequently purchased packaged goods context. Promotion policy is the equilibrium outcomes of a dynamic game between consumers and the manufacturer. Consumers form expectation over future promotions and strategically time their purchase to coincide with the manufacturer’s promotion events. The forward-looking manufacturer takes this consumer behavior into account and dynamically evaluates promotional response of consumers in each choice segment based on their inventory levels when making optimal promotion decisions. Our analysis comprises of two steps. In the first step, we obtain heterogeneous demand side parameters with a dynamic structural model. Consumers decide whether to buy, which brand to buy and how much to buy conditional on their rational expectations of future promotions. In the second step, we specify a dynamic game between consumers and the manufacturer and solve for the optimal promotion policies, taking the structural demand-side parameters from the first step as given. Our empirical analysis is based on household level panel data in the canned tuna category, which comprises two major brands—StarKist and Chicken of the Sea. We focus on studying StarKist, the market leader’s promotion decisions. The estimates of the demand-side model imply that there are two segments of households in the investigated market. Households in segment one have a strong preference over StarKist and are less promotion sensitive. We name households in this segment loyals. Households in segment two are very sensitive to promotions and have weak preference over StarKist. We name households in segment two brand switchers. Conditional on these demand characteristics, we find that it is optimal for the manufacturer to promote when the mean inventory for brand switchers is sufficiently low and the optimal discount depth decreases in the mean inventory for brand switchers. We empirically measure the extent to which forward-looking behavior by consumers affects the manufacturer’s optimal promotion policy. We find that StarKist promotes less oft… (PsycInfo (2022) Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","N/A","N/A","0","2",NA,"Liu, Yan","2011","https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/essays-on-consumer-promotion-timing-expectations/docview/864619353/se-2?accountid=14026","APA PsycInfo (2022)"
"693","Understanding willingness-to-pay formation of repeat bidders in sequential online auctions","A growing number of vendors are using a sequence of online auctions to sell large inventories of identical items. Although bidding strategies and bidder behavior in single auctions have been extensively studied, limited research exists on bidding in sequential auctions. We seek to explain how bidders in such an environment learn from the information, and form and update their willingness to pay (WTP). Using a large data set from an online auction retailer, we analyze the evolution of the bidders’ WTP as well as the effect of auction design on bidders’ WTP in sequential auctions. We see our study in the context of a longitudinal field experiment, in which we were able to track actions of repeat bidders over an extended period of time. Our results show that bidders’ WTP in sequential auctions can be explained from their demand characteristics, their participation experience in previous auctions, outcomes in previous auctions, and auction design parameters. We also observe, characterize, and measure what we call a modified demand reduction effect exhibited across different auctions, over time, by multiunit demand bidders. Our findings are important to enable better auction mechanism design, and more sophisticated bidding tools that explore the rich information environment of sequential auctions.

"694","Unintended effects of memory on decision making: A breakdown in access control","A hybrid evaluative-conditioning/source-monitoring paradigm is put forward as an alternative to the standard evaluative-conditioning paradigm. The first experiment paired brand names with a small number of attractive or unattractive female faces and used a likeability rating task as well as a source monitoring task. The second experiment paired words which differed along a masculine–feminine dimension with male and female faces, and used a speeded judgment about whether words were stereotypically masculine or feminine. The third experiment paired words that differed along an active–inactive dimension with male and female faces and used a variation of the Implicit Association Test where judgments about whether words were active or inactive were mixed with judgments about whether faces were male or female. In all three experiments, we observed transfer between the recently acquired information and the judgment task. In addition, the three experiments progressively reduce the probability of demand characteristics. We explain the results in this paradigm, and in many other paradigms, as a breakdown in access control. We also point to several similarities between existing theories of evaluative conditioning and memory phenomena/theories that have gone unnoticed in the evaluative conditioning literature.

"695","Effects of brief and sham mindfulness meditation on mood and cardiovascular variables","Objectives: Although long-term meditation has been found to reduce negative mood and cardiovascular variables, the effects of a brief mindfulness meditation intervention when compared to a sham mindfulness meditation intervention are relatively unknown. This experiment examined whether a 3-day (1-hour total) mindfulness or sham mindfulness meditation intervention would improve mood and cardiovascular variables when compared to a control group. Methods: Eighty-two (82) undergraduate students (34 males, 48 females), with no prior meditation experience, participated in three sessions that involved training in either mindfulness meditation, sham mindfulness meditation, or a control group. Heart rate, blood pressure, and psychologic variables (Profile of Mood States, State Anxiety Inventory) were assessed before and after the intervention. Results: The meditation intervention was more effective at reducing negative mood, depression, fatigue, confusion, and heart rate, when compared to the sham and control groups. Conclusions: These results indicate that brief meditation training has beneficial effects on mood and cardiovascular variables that go beyond the demand characteristics of a sham meditation intervention.

"696","Feelings don't come easy: Studies on the effortful nature of feelings","We propose that experience of emotion is a mental phenomenon, which requires resources. This hypothesis implies that a concurrent cognitive load diminishes the intensity of feeling since the 2 activities are competing for the same resources. Two sets of experiments tested this hypothesis. The first line of experiments (Experiments 1–4) examined the intensity of participants' feelings as they performed a secondary (backward counting) task. The results showed that the intensity of both negative and positive feelings diminished under a cognitive load and that this attenuation of feeling was not mediated by either distraction from external stimuli or demand characteristics. In the second set of experiments (Experiments 5–6), load was created by asking the participants to focus on the feelings. Even in these circumstances, the participants who were under load reported a lower intensity of feeling than those who were not under load. We explain these findings in terms of a resource-dependent model of emotional experience. Possible implications of our findings for a broader class of phenomenological experiences are succinctly discussed.

"697","Bias versus bias: Harnessing hindsight to reveal paranormal belief change beyond demand characteristics","Psychological change is difficult to assess, in part because self-reported beliefs and attitudes may be biased or distorted. The present study probed belief change, in an educational context, by using the hindsight bias to counter another bias that generally plagues assessment of subjective change. Although research has indicated that skepticism courses reduce paranormal beliefs, those findings may reflect demand characteristics (biases toward desired, skeptical responses). Our hindsight-bias procedure circumvented demand by asking students, following semester-long skepticism (and control) courses, to recall their precourse levels of paranormal belief. People typically remember themselves as previously thinking, believing, and acting as they do now, so current skepticism should provoke false recollections of previous skepticism. Given true belief change, therefore, skepticism students should have remembered themselves as having been more skeptical than they were. They did, at least about paranormal topics that were covered most extensively in the course. Our findings thus show hindsight to be useful in evaluating cognitive change beyond demand characteristics.

"698","Effects of alcohol priming on social disinhibition","Recent studies have suggested that exposure to rudimentary alcohol cues activates mental representations of alcohol expectancies in long-term memory, thereby promoting expectancy-consistent behavior changes. However, reliance in these previous studies on self-report measures raises the possibility that prior findings were an artifact of experimental demand. The present study was aimed at ruling out this alternative explanation by reinvestigating the effects of alcohol priming on nonconsumptive behavior using an implicit measure of social disinhibition. In three experiments, participants were exposed to either alcohol or control beverage images, then asked to type as quickly as possible the first word that came to mind in response to a series of provocative (e.g., feces ) and neutral (e.g., chair ) stimulus words. Participants’ response times were surreptitiously measured. Results revealed that participants exposed to images of alcohol, relative to control beverages, were faster to generate free associations to provocative, but not neutral, words, suggesting enhanced social disinhibition. This effect was limited to conditions of heightened evaluation, ruling out alternative explanations based on knowledge activation or arousal. Participants reported no suspicions regarding the connection between the image viewing and free association tasks nor any awareness that their response times had been collected. Results suggest that the behavioral effects of alcohol priming do not result from demand characteristics and offer the first evidence that exposure to rudimentary alcohol-related stimuli may suffice to influence social disinhibition in a manner akin to that expected to result from actual or placebo alcohol consumption.

To accomplish this objective two survey instruments were administered to randomly selected licensed dentists and dental hygienists in the state of Florida. Dental hygienists represented the potential student base for the proposed programs, and dentists represented the potential and prospective employers of graduated students of the proposed programs. To determine demand and demand characteristics, one survey instrument was mailed to 1,000 dental hygienists who were randomly selected using SAS software from a population of N=12,066 dental hygienists actively licensed to practice in the state of Florida. This sample of hygienists was approximately 8.3% of the total population. Of the 1,000 samples, 134 (or 13.4%) were returned. Of the 134 surveys returned, 123 (n=123) were included in this study. Eleven surveys were not included because of a majority of missing data or because the respondent indicated he or she already possessed a Bachelor or Master degree. A Likert-scale questionnaire was sent to each group of actively licensed dentists and actively licensed dental hygienists from the state of Florida. Responses from dental hygienists were overwhelmingly positive towards the addition of the Bachelor of Science degree program with an online distance-learning component. Those in favor of the Bachelor of Science degree program also provided a favorable response towards adding a Master of Science degree program in dental hygiene. The dentists, as potential future employers, also showed strong support in their responses for the additional degree programs with an additional management track component and believed it would elevate the professional standards of the dental hygiene field.

Design: Two hundred forty-eight participants were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 conditions: questionnaire-only; questionnaire plus planning instruction; questionnaire, planning instruction plus experimenter-provided implementation intention; or questionnaire, planning instruction plus self-generated implementation intention. Main Outcome Measure: Alcohol intake. Results: There were clinically and statistically significant decreases in alcohol consumption in the 2 experimental conditions, but not in the 2 control conditions, F (3, 237) = 3.34, p &lt; .05, <U+03B7> p ² = .04. There were no significant differences between experimenter-provided and self-generated implementation intentions ( p = .62). Compliance moderated the effects of self-generated implementation intentions only, such that alcohol intake only significantly decreased in participants who complied with the instructions, F (1, 52) = 4.20, p &lt; .05, <U+03B7> p ² = .07. However, simply choosing an experimenter-provided implementation intention was just as effective as writing it out in full, implying that implementation intentions work even with minimal information processing. Conclusion: The findings further support use of implementation intentions to protect against health risk behaviors and are congruent with laboratory research showing that implementation intentions are a case of strategic automaticity.

"701","Foster parenting practices as predictors of foster child outcomes","Three studies were undertaken to explore foster parenting practices (parental nurturance, parent-youth conflict, and parent-youth shared activities) as predictors of psychosocial outcomes (pro-social behaviour, emotional disorder, conduct disorder, and indirect aggression) in youths aged 10-17 years and living in foster homes in Ontario from 2001-2004. The first study included cross-sectional hierarchical regression analyses using data collected from 367 foster youths in 2001-2002. The second study replicated cross-sectional analyses with data collected from 439 foster youths in 2002-2003. It also included a longitudinal investigation of 201 foster youth present for both years of the study, permitting a more thorough exploration of reciprocal causal mechanisms. The third study explored the added influence of a fourth parenting practice: parental monitoring, using data collected from 143 foster youths in 2002-2004. Statistical controls included demographic variables (foster youth gender and age) and contextual variables (length of time in foster placement, total number of youth in foster household). It was hypothesized that the same trends observed in broader parenting research would also apply within the context of foster families, and therefore that more frequent engagement in positive parenting practices would predict improved foster youth outcomes. Results for the three studies provided inconsistent support for the hypotheses. Parenting practices, as a set, accounted for a modest, statistically significant increment in the variance explained in several of the foster youth outcomes (and always in the direction expected). However, the predictive power of individual parenting practices varied, with parent-youth conflict serving as the most consistent predictor. Another predictor, parent-youth shared activities, was not significant in any of the regressions. Study limitations were discussed for each study, including the demand characteristics of the larger research project, the differing nature of the foster parent-foster youth relationship, and the potential role of other unaccounted-for moderators. Also, parenting practices were conceptualized as fluid, reciprocal processes, for which further research is needed to better operationalize and measure salient aspects. Despite limited findings, the thesis remains an important one in presenting one of the first looks at the impact of foster parenting at-risk youth in Ontario.

The couples in the intervention group were instructed to provide their partners with five statements of praise and/or gratitude (positive communication) and no more than one statement of criticism (negative communication) per day. DeMoss's control couples ""experienced nothing but the passage of time during the 21-day period"" (DeMoss, 2004, p. 22). In this investigation, however, the comparison group was also instructed to log statements of praise and/or gratitude, as well as statements of criticism. The purpose of this modification was to control for demand characteristics, which seemed rather significant when evaluating DeMoss's methodology. Analysis revealed that positive daily communication in the form of expressed gratitudes did not improve relationship satisfaction. That is, an individual's marital satisfaction score did not increase relative to the positivity of statements received from his/her spouse. However, controlling for demand characteristics by asking the comparison group to record positive statements as they naturally occur did decrease the effect size between the comparison group and the intervention group as compared to DeMoss's 2004 investigation.

"703","Stress and anxiety reduction factors among law enforcement officers","The purpose of this study was to determine if the use of humorous video, especially humor that produces laughter, would prove effective and valuable in reducing the level and degree of anxiety among law enforcement officers. Prior studies have incorporated the use of humorous video to successfully reduce stress and anxiety levels among other populations. Seventy-nine officers from two law enforcement agencies participated in this study. The experimental participants were given a first-round of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, Speilberger, Gorusch, Vagg, &amp; Jacobs, 1983) then shown a short laughter-producing humorous video, after which a second round of the measurement was administered. A 30-day follow-up STAI Self-Evaluation Questionnaire was also administered. Officers from the control participant group followed the same procedures, but were shown a non-laughter producing video travelogue of the same duration. Analysis was conducted and significant reductions between STAI state scores before and after viewing the videos were determined and found to be similar for both groups. Thirty-day follow-up STAI state scores increased, indicating the effects of the video wore off for the experimental group; however, there was no effect on state scores for the control group. Thirty-day follow-up scores revealed no effect on trait for the experimental group; however, testing of the control group revealed a decrease in trait scores. Results suggest the travelogue video shown to the control group may not have been truly neutral and may have evoked a sense of escape and rest thereby contributing to measured lower levels of state anxiety. Additionally, it is suggested demand characteristics may have influenced participants and impacted subsequent results.

"704","Burnout among child/adolescent therapists in community mental health outpatient settings: A pathway to understanding","Burnout, a period in which fatigue and frustration occur when a person is devoted to a way of life but is not meeting expectations in that area (Vredenburgh, Carlozzi, &amp; Stein, 1999) has been reported and observed in individuals in the helping professions. Community mental health outpatient settings employ many helping professionals, including therapists. Such settings provide services to a varied clientele ranging in demographics and age. Specifically, children and adolescents present with their own unique demand characteristics that impact and contribute to burnout among those who provide them treatment. This study measured the level of burnout (using Maslach Burnout Inventory) of 42 individuals, with at least a master's degree, working in community mental health outpatient settings who provided therapeutic services to children and adolescents. Demographic characteristics did not demonstrate a relationship to the dimension of Emotional Exhaustion in burnout, but select variables did demonstrate a relationship with the dimensions of Depersonalization and Personal accomplishment. Further research in needed to better understand the broad scope of contributing factors (particularly factors outside of the workplace) and preventive factors to burnout.

"705","Performance evaluation for implementations of a network of proxy caches","In a network of proxy-level caches, such as IRCache (www.ircache.net), nodes collaborate with one another to satisfy object requests. However, since collaboration in current implementations of proxy cache networks is typically limited to sharing cache contents, there may be unnecessary redundancies in storing objects. It is expected that a mechanism that considers the objects cached at every node in the network would be more effective for reducing user delays. In this study we construct algorithms for different implementations of such a mechanism using the theoretical approach of Tawarmalani et al. [Tawarmalani, M., Karthik, K., and De, P., Allocating Objects in a Network of Caches: Centralized and Decentralized Analyses, (2007) Purdue University Working Paper] that investigate caching policies where nodes do consider objects held by their neighbors. The caching implementations are also compared and contrasted with numerical computations using simulated data. The performance results should provide useful directions for computer network administrators to develop proxy caching implementations that are suited for differing network and demand characteristics. There is a significant potential for deploying proxy cache networks in order to reduce the delays experienced by web users due to increasing congestion on the Internet. Therefore we believe that this study contributes to network caching research that is beneficial for Internet users.

"706","Comparing online and lab methods in a problem-solving experiment","Online experiments have recently become very popular, and--in comparison with traditional lab experiments--they may have several advantages, such as reduced demand characteristics, automation, and generalizability of results to wider populations (Birnbaum, 2004; Reips, 2000, 2002a, 2002b). We replicated Dandurand, Bowen, and Shultz's (2004) lab-based problem-solving experiment as an Internet experiment. Consistent with previous results, we found that participants who watched demonstrations of successful problem-solving sessions or who read instructions outperformed those who were told only that they solved problems correctly or not. Online participants were less accurate than lab participants, but there was no interaction with learning condition. Thus, we conclude that online and Internet results are consistent. Disadvantages included high dropout rate for online participants; however, combining the online experiment with the department subject pool worked well.

"707","Belief in free will: Measurement and conceptualization innovations","Though the existence of free will seems to be a background assumption in Western life, very little research has examined the belief, and the handful of studies that have done so suggest only a modest endorsement and unclear relationships to other variables. However, methodological flaws in the earlier studies likely produced an underestimation of the strength of the belief among the general population. The current study developed and then administered a new measure of belief in free will to samples of senior high school and college students under conditions where demand characteristics were controlled. Both age groups endorsed the belief in free will to a much stronger extent than seen in previous research. Further, adults associated belief in free will with three purposes of punishment (rehabilitation, retribution, and deterrence) but adolescents only related the belief to retribution. Adults produced a negative correlation between the belief in free will and locus of control whereas adolescents evidenced no association between the variables. Both age groups demonstrated significant correlations between the belief and self-esteem. Finally, adolescents evidenced no correlation between the belief and religious conviction while adults produced a negative correlation between the two variables. In addition, the new free will instrument demonstrated extraordinary factor consistency between both samples. The results are discussed in the context of competing behavior analytic views regarding the origin of the belief in free will (cultural conditioning versus evolutionary adaptation) and the implications the origin has for progressive social and cultural change.

"708","Therapist turnover and new program sustainability in mental health clinics as a function of organizational culture, climate, and service structure","The present study incorporates organizational theory and organizational characteristics in examining issues related to the successful implementation of mental health services. Following the theoretical foundations of socio-technical and cultural models of organizational effectiveness, organizational climate, culture, legal and service structures, and workforce characteristics are examined as correlates of therapist turnover and new program sustainability in a nationwide sample of mental health clinics. Results of General Linear Modeling (GLM) with the organization as the unit of analysis revealed that organizations with the best climates as measured by the Organizational Social Context (OSC) profiling system, had annual turnover rates (10%) that were less than half the rates found in organizations with the worst climates (22%). In addition, organizations with the best culture profiles sustained new treatment or service programs over twice as long (50 vs. 24 months) as organizations with the worst cultures. Finally, clinics with separate children's services units had higher turnover rates than clinics that served adults and children within the same unit. The findings suggest that strategies to support the implementation of new mental health treatments and services should attend to organizational culture and climate, and to the compatibility of organizational service structures with the demand characteristics of treatments.

"709","Hypnosis and smoking cessation: Anesthetization of craving","Hypnosis using Spiegel and Spiegel's (1978) procedure has been shown to have outcomes ranging from 20-43% with long-term abstinence rates for smoking cessation (Barabasz, Baer, Sheehan, &amp; Barabasz, 1986; Spiegel, 1997). However, this procedure does not directly address the craving for nicotine. This study tested the efficacy of 1.5-hour treatments comparing Spiegel and Spiegel's (1978) standardized smoking cessation procedure, the same procedure with Barabasz's (1999) additional suggestions to anesthetize the craving for nicotine, and a placebo control consisting of demand characteristics with a strong expectation for smoking cessation using a ""subliminal"" messages recording. It was hypothesized that the addition of a suggestion to anesthetize the craving for nicotine to the therapeutic intervention would reduce the recidivism rate in contrast to either the traditional procedure or the placebo intervention. Volunteers (N = 75) who were 18 years of age, had smoked at least 10 cigarettes daily for 12 months or more and who ranked their stress levels to be moderate and motivation to be strong on a standardized Likert scale were given the HGSS:A (Shor and Orne, 1962) during a 90 minute group briefing and hypnosis session. Volunteers scoring 6 or above were invited to return for a 90 minute individual session where all were given the SHCS (Morgan and Hilgard, 1975). Those scoring 2.5 or above were balanced as randomly as possibly by hypnotizability levels and placed into one of the three groups each with an N of 25. Standardized interviews were conducted at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. Those who abstained at 3 months were asked to return for cotinine testing using saliva samples. Results indicated no significant difference in within or between group measures due to a high degree of variance within groups of numbers of cigarettes smoked at pretreatment levels. Depth of trance, the level of experience of the hypnotist and negative expectancy on the part of chronic smokers may have contributed to the lack of significance.

Ss were 287 undergraduates. Manipulation of stimulation was attempted, by markedly reducing sensory input without S's prior expectancy, thereby minimizing the possible occurrence of differential demand characteristics. 7 measures of extraversion were used to select the final S samples (N=66).

Predicted performance decrements and reminiscence were not manifested.

These previous studies were carefully replicated, but the results were not confirmed.

Participants in the Extinction Group (for which response rates were low in extinction) were instructed that the experimenter expected them to continue responding in extinction after a second exposure to the VR schedule. Participants in the Persistence group (for which response rates were high in extinction) were instructed that the experimenter expected them to stop responding in extinction. Relative to the condition in which instructions were absent, extinction-response rates increased and decreased, respectively, for participants in the Persistence and Extinction groups.

"722","The nature of hypnosis. artifact and essence: An experimental study","A model is tested that hypnosis is a state characterized by (1) an increased motivation to please the hypnotist, (2) a desire on the part of the subject to play the role of a hypnotized subject, and (3) an altered state of consciousness. Section I shows how the hypnotist's and the subject's prior ideas of what hypnosis is define many aspects of the trance state. To study this, college students were given a special demonstration of hypnosis which included an item of behavior, catalepsy of the dominant hand, which had never been observed to occur spontaneously. Students from the class who witnessed this demonstration tended to show this characteristic in hypnosis, while control subjects (who had not seen the demonstration) never showed it. Section II demonstrates the effect of role-play artifact. It was hypothesized that subjects' perceptions of the implicit cues inherent in the experimental procedure---termed here as the ""demand characteristics"" of the experiment---determine the subjects' results. This study employed individuals in hypnosis who were given suggestions that they subjectively experience the feelings of being rich, poor, and finally themselves. Previously subjects given these hypnotic suggestions had shown dramatic differences in size of coin estimates (the Bruner-Goodman effect). Our replication demonstrated that individuals who simulated hypnosis by role playing---with a ""blind"" experimenter who did not know if he was working with a real hypnosis or simulating hypnosis subject---produced the same data as subjects in deep hypnosis. In order to take experimental results at face value, special controls for these cues are essential. Section III deals with the effect of increased motivation on physical capacity in hypnosis. Studies have shown that the subject in hypnosis is capable of transcending his normal physical capacity by 16% or more. However, because the hypnotic state itself is inherently motivating, the same wording of instructions may well convey different meanings in the hypnotic state versus the normal state. To study this, in deep hypnosis each subject's level of ""maximal"" physical capacity for holding a kilogram weight at arm's length was obtained. Then one-half hour after the subject was awakened with posthypnotic amnesia for this experience, the subject was again asked to hold the weight at arm's length. Ego involving instructions and motivational techniques were used at this time. Under these circumstances, all nine subjects demonstrated their ability to hold the weight longer in the wake state than they had in hypnosis. Section IV elaborates the rationale for having subjects simulate hypnosis, with instructions to ""fool"" another experimenter who actually does not know whether or not the subject is or is not in hypnosis. Pilot studies indicated that subjects in deep hypnosis showed logical inconsistencies---termed here ""trance logic""---not shown by simulating subjects.

"723","Resolving conflict in hypnosis","This thesis investigated the management of conflict between reality and suggestion during hypnosis. The eight experiments conducted for this thesis investigated the social, motivational, and cognitive factors that mediate participants' response to conflict during a negative visual hallucination. Chapter 1 reviews the relevant literature and presents the rationale for the program of research. Chapter 2 presents Experiments 1 and 2, which explored hypnotic participants' capacity to manage conflict under different conditions. The findings indicated that cognitive and behavioural strategies that allow participants to avoid conflict are useful, but not essential, in managing hypnotic conflict. Chapter 3 presents Experiment 3, which developed a paradigm that allowed conflict to be manipulated in a way that minimised response cues. The findings indicated that gradually and unobtrusively modifying a stimulus influenced participants' responses even though participants did not indicate any knowledge that the stimulus was manipulated. Chapter 4 presents Experiment 4, which investigated the relevance of hypnotisability and hypnosis to conflict management. The findings indicated that hypnosis provides a context in which hypnotisable participants are able to maintain their belief despite demanding levels of conflict. Chapter 5 presents Experiments 5 and 6, which focused on the role of social demands in participants' response to hypnotic conflict. The findings indicated that demand characteristics shape participants' interpretation of the appropriate response to conflict during an hypnotic suggestion. Chapter 6 presents Experiments 7 and 8, which addressed the relevance of cognitive processes to hypnotic conflict management. The findings indicated that participants used cognitive strategies to manage conflict that were appropriate to the suggestion, degree of conflict, and their individual abilities. Overall, the findings indicated that hypnotic participants' management of conflict involves motivated, strategic responding so as to maintain a belief that events are as communicated by the hypnotist. These issues are discussed within a theoretical perspective that is presented in Chapter 7. This perspective emphasises the hypnotisability of participants, the role of hypnotic induction, participants' interpretation of the desired response, the belief that participants develop in the reality of the suggested events, and the readiness of participants to employ conflict management strategies that produce the appropriate outcome.

"724","The debiasing of judgmental errors associated with anxiety","It was the goal of the current study to investigate one debiasing technique and its ability to reduce judgmental errors. In addition, a rival hypothesis of demand characteristics was examined as a possible explanation of any findings of the reduction of judgmental errors. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or a debiasing group and asked to rate the likelihood of several hypothetical events in a 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 (Gender x Anxiety Group x Treatment Group x Repeated Measure) repeated measures experimental design. Level of anxiety responsiveness was measured to arrange subjects into a ""normal"" and a highly anxious group. It was hypothesized that highly anxious participants would report higher probability estimates of future threat-related events relative to participants with a ""normal"" level of anxiety responsiveness, a main effect for anxiety. Secondly, it was hypothesized that a two-way interaction of treatment group and repeated measure upon threat probability ratings would be found. Third, it was hypothesized that a two-way interaction of gender and anxiety upon threat probability ratings would be found. Finally, it was hypothesized that there would be no main effects or interaction effects involving the repeated measure and the experimental demand independent variable. A mixed factorial design 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA was conducted using the threat probability ratings as the dependent variable. In addition, two separate analyses were conducted using the experimental demand stimuli as the dependent variable to investigate demand characteristics as an explanation of the debiasing. The results showed that the debiasing procedure was effective in the reduction of judgmental errors. In addition, it was found that demand characteristics could not account for the reduction in pessimistic threat-related predictions. The results were discussed in terms of cognitive biases and implications for cognitive behavior therapy.

Overall, workload and performance are sensitive to multiple characteristics of the task and not instantaneous demand level alone. These findings are important in explaining why association and dissociation occur between task demand, operator efficiency, and perceived workload in differing performance contexts.

A. Velten, 1968) mood induction procedure in 4 studies with a total of 286 undergraduates. Ss read 60 mood-related statements and then read brief incubation instructions (with elation, neutral, or depression mood conditions) and incubated for 3 min prior to the first time that their moods were measured. Results indicate that this method is successful in inducing moods. This technique avoids the problems associated with assigning groups to conditions but retains the economy of group sessions. This modified procedure, with the inclusion of an incubation period, led to mood change lasting up to 35 min. Further, the modified Velten procedure resulted in mood differences even after various intervening tasks. The technique was discussed in terms of demand characteristics, experimenter bias, local history, and ethics.

"728","Response shift and the retrospective pretest: On the usefulness of retrospective pretest-posttest designs in detecting training related response shifts","Many trainers assert that evaluation studies often erroneously fail to document the benefits of their training. In the present research, reference is made to a specific confounding influence that occurs when trainings are evaluated utilizing pretest-posttest designs that employ self-report measures as outcome criteria. Whenever educational trainings change participants' understanding of the dimension under consideration, a response shift occurs. This change in internal standard of measurement renders self-report pre- and postscores incompatible. Although results demonstrate that the use of retrospective pretests is promising, it is still fraught with problems that need systematic investigation. The present series of laboratory and field experiments attempted to delineate the conditions under which response shifts occur, and retrospective pretests are appropriate. Each experiment evaluated an educational training by making use of a 'retrospective pretest-posttest control group design,"" including both self-report and non-self-report measures of change. Most participants were university students. Validity threats to the retrospective design were examined, such as the influence of response-style effects and demand characteristics. In addition, specific problems were studied, like pretesting and time effects, and the administration procedure. The general conclusion is that the accumulated results suggest that retrospective pretest-posttest designs do add a valuable dimension to our evaluation tools.

"729","Restricted environmental stimulation and the enhancement of hypnotizability: Pain, EEG alpha, skin conductance and temperature processes","The Stanford Hypnotic Clinical Scale (SHCS), which included a posthypnotic suggestion for an analgesic reaction, and pain threshold and tolerance tests were administered to 10 college students prior to restricted environmental stimulation technique (REST), immediately after REST, and 10–24 days later. Occipital EEG alpha, skin conductance, and peripheral, core, and chamber temperature data were collected prior to, during, and after REST. A control group of 10 Ss was used to assess the effects of repeated hypnosis on susceptibility scores and demand characteristics of the experiment. MANOVAs showed SHCS and pain tolerance scores to be significantly enhanced for Ss exposed to REST immediately after and 10–24 days later. EEG alpha density increased significantly in REST, but the increase was not progressive during the REST period. The maintenance of hypnotizability and pain tolerance at follow-up failed to support J. Reyher's (1964) theory of brain function and behavioral regulation. E. R. Hilgard's (1977) neodissociation interpretation, combined with J. R. Hilgard's (1974, 1979) findings on imaginative involvement, is viewed as a possible explanation.

ANOVAs on ratio scores of productivity measures indicated the instructional manipulation was effective in producing different kinds and amounts of talk by condition. Analyses of questionnaire (S satisfaction) items indicated significant condition effects were infrequent and found only on the follow-up questionnaire. These results are discussed in terms of the demand characteristics of the experimental setting. Results suggest that the theoretical argument regarding the overall superiority of an affective or rational approach to counseling is oversimplified.

Thus, it is difficult using that instrument to determine if individuals view themselves as more risky than others because of a cultural value of risk or instructional demand characteristics. The present study asked 226 college students to make judgments for themselves and for others on either the choice dilemmas (with risk-oriented or risk-neutral instructions) or on 1 of 3 other measures of risk taking (behavior prediction scale, risk of aversive consequences, or zero expected value bets) which have exhibited the risky shift but do not have the instructional problems of the choice dilemmas. Only on the choice dilemmas did Ss view themselves as being more risky. On all other measures Ss viewed themselves as either equal to or more conservative than others.

As was predicted, this latter manipulation reduced performance levels in the verbal conditioning situation. This supports the interpretation that awareness of demand characteristics and an intention to cooperate are critical factors in obtaining the experimental effect, and that cooperation depends upon low levels of evaluation apprehension. Ss who were fully cooperating rapidly shifted to the new pronoun when the reinforcement contingency changed. Unaware and uncooperative aware Ss showed no change after the shift, although most uncooperative aware Ss were aware that the shift had occurred.

"733","Promoting farsighted decisions via episodic future thinking: A meta-analysis","Episodic future thinking (EFT) denotes our capacity to imagine prospective events. It has been suggested to promote farsighted decisions that entail a trade-off between short-term versus long-term gains. Here, we meta-analyze the evidence for the impact of EFT on such intertemporal choices that have monetary or health-relevant consequences. Across 174 effect sizes from 48 articles, a three-level model yielded a medium-sized effect of g = .44, 95% (CI) [.33, .55]. Notably, this analysis included a substantial number of unpublished experiments, and the effect remained significant following further adjustments for remaining publication bias. We exploited the observed heterogeneity to determine critical core components that moderate the impact of EFT. Specifically, the effect was stronger when the imagined events were positive, more vivid, and related to the delayed choice. We further obtained evidence for the contribution of the episodicity and future-orientedness of EFT. These results indicate that the impact of EFT cannot simply be accounted for by other modes of prospection (e.g., semantic future thinking). Of note, EFT had a greater impact in samples characterized by choice impulsivity (e.g., in obesity), suggesting that EFT can ameliorate maladaptive decision making. It may accordingly constitute a beneficial intervention for individuals who tend to make myopic decisions. Our analyses moreover indicated that the effect is unlikely to merely reflect demand characteristics. This meta-analysis highlights the potential of EFT in promoting long-term goals, a finding that extends from the laboratory to real-life decisions.

"734","Memory and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy: A potentially risky combination in the courtroom","ABSTRACT Do Eye Movement and Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy affect the accuracy of memories? This recurrent issue in recent memory research bears relevance to expert witness work in the courtroom. In this review, we will argue that several crucial aspects of EMDR may be detrimental to memory. First, research has shown that eye movements undermine the quality and quantity of memory. Specifically, eye movements have been shown to decrease the vividness and emotionality of autobiographical experiences and amplify spontaneous false memory levels. Second, a sizeable proportion of EMDR practitioners endorse the controversial idea of repressed memories and discuss the topic of repressed memory in therapy. Third, in the Dutch EMDR protocol, patients are instructed to select the target image by using flawed metaphors of memory (e.g., memory works as a video). Such instructions may create demand characteristics to the effect that people over-interpret imagery during therapy as veridical memories. Collectively, the corpus of research suggests that several components of EMDR therapy (i.e., performing eye movements, therapist beliefs and therapeutic instructions) may undermine the accuracy of memory, which can be risky if patients, later on, serve as witnesses in legal proceedings.

"736","Effectiveness of a transdiagnostic treatment for low emotion efficacy","This study was a quantitative randomized waitlist-controlled effectiveness trial of an 8-week, transdiagnostic treatment protocol, ""Emotion Efficacy Therapy"" (EET). EET integrates Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Exposure Therapy, and Dialectical Behavior Therapy. Emotion efficacy was conceptualized as ability to adaptively regulate emotion and behavior plus belief in one's ability to do so. The general clinical sample was recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area, through newspaper advertising, online advertising, local flyer distribution, and local treatment programs. The primary hypothesis was: the treatment group will decrease more in emotion dysregulation (ED), measured by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), than the waitlist control group. The secondary hypotheses were: the treatment group will decrease more than the control group, as measured by the six DERS subscales. The exploratory hypotheses were: the treatment group will decrease more than the control group for: 1) experiential avoidance, measured by the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II; 2) distress intolerance, measured by the Distress Intolerance Index; 3) values-incongruent living, measured by the Valuing Questionnaire; and 4) depression, anxiety, and stress, measured by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21. Results showed greater change in the treatment group for overall ED, for three of the six ED factors and for one factor of values-congruent living, with effect sizes ranging from small to large. These results provide strong support for the primary hypothesis, mixed support for the secondary hypotheses, and little support for exploratory hypotheses. The results suggest EET may be comparable to or more effective than other brief, group-format treatments for ED. This study's limitations include a small sample size (n=41); variability in participants' baselines; lack of follow-up measurements; therapist effects; reliance on self-report measures; practice effects; experimenter expectancy effects; and demand characteristics. Thus, the results should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, the large effect size for the primary hypothesis suggests EET may be an effective treatment for ED. Future research should target replication, investigating discrepancies between this study and the prior EET trial, increasing extraneous variable control such as participants' baselines, identifying mediating and moderating variables in EET's effectiveness, and obtaining follow-up measurements.

"737","Cross-trained workforce planning models","Cross-training has emerged as an effective method for increasing workforce flexibility in the face of uncertain demand. Despite recently receiving substantial attention in workforce planning literature, a number of challenges towards making the best use of cross-training remain. Most notably, approaches to automating the allocation of workers to their skills are typically not scalable to industrial sized problems. Secondly, insights into the nature of valuable cross-training actions are restricted to a small set of predefined structures.This thesis develops a multi-period cross-trained workforce planning model with temporal demand flexibility. Temporal demand flexibility enables the flow of incomplete work (or carryover ) across the planning horizon to be modelled, as well as an the option to utilise spare capacity by completing some work early. Set in a proposed Aggregate Planning stage, the model permits the planning of large and complex workforces over a horizon of many months and provides a bridge between the traditional Tactical and Operational stages of workforce planning. The performance of the different levels of planning flexibility the model offers is evaluated in an industry motivated case study. An extensive numerical study, under various supply and demand characteristics, leads to an evaluation of the value of cross-training as a supply strategy in this domain.The problem of effectively staffing a pre-fixed training structure (such as the modified chain or block) is an aspect of cross-training which has been extensively studied in the literature. In this thesis, we attempt to address the more frequently faced problem of 'how should we train our existing workforce to improve demand coverage?'. We propose a two-stage stochastic programming model which extends existing literature by allowing the structure of cross-training to vary freely. The benefit of the resulting targeted training solutions are shown in application using a case study provided by BT. A wider numerical study highlights 'rules-of-thumb' for effective training solutions under a variety of characteristics for uncertain demand.

"738","Applying insights from magic to improve deception in research: The Swiss cheese model","Social psychologists, placebo scientists, and consumer researchers often require deception in their studies, yet they receive little training on how to deceive effectively. Ineffective deception, however, can lead to suspicion and compromise the validity of research. The field of magic offers a potential solution; magicians have deceived audiences for millennia using a variety of robust techniques. As former professional magicians, we propose the Swiss cheese model of deception and argue that deception should be subtle yet elaborate. Subtle deception involves techniques such as fake mistakes, planted assumptions, and convincers. Elaborate deception involves layering many of these techniques rather than relying on a single cover story. We have demonstrated the potency of these principles by making participants believe implausible ideas, such as that a machine is controlling their mind or that the placebo they consumed was a psychedelic drug. These principles can help researchers reduce demand characteristics, improve blinding, and increase the generalisability of studies that require deception.

"739","How to study the menstrual cycle: Practical tools and recommendations","Despite decades of research on the physiological and psychological effects of the menstrual cycle, studies have not sufficiently adopted consistent methods for operationalizing the menstrual cycle. This has resulted in substantial confusion in the literature and limited possibilities to conduct systematic reviews and meta-analyses. In order to facilitate more rapid accumulation of knowledge on cycle effects, the present paper offers a set of integrative guidelines and standardized tools for studying the menstrual cycle as an independent variable. We begin with (1) an overview of the menstrual cycle and (2) premenstrual disorders, followed by (3) recommendations and tools regarding data collection in cycle studies. These recommendations address selecting the appropriate study design and sampling strategy, managing demand characteristics, identifying a sample of naturally-cycling individuals, and measuring menstrual bleeding dates, ovarian hormones, and ovulation. We proceed with suggestions for (4) data preparation and coding of cycle day and phases, as well as (5) data visualization, statistical modeling, and interpretation of menstrual cycle associations. We also provide (6) recommendations for using menses start day and ovulation testing to schedule visits in laboratory studies and end with a (7) comprehensive summary and conclusion. Regardless of whether the influence of the menstrual cycle is of central interest in a study or should be controlled to accurately assess the effects of another variable, the use of these recommendations and tools will help make study results more meaningful and replicable.

"740","Movie smoking and teen smoking behavior: A critical methodological and meta-analytic review","Policymakers and some scholars have expressed concerns regarding potential links between youth viewing smoking in movies and smoking in real life. Some advocacy groups have expressed the view that causal links between movie smoking and youth smoking definitively exist. However, research on actual smoking behaviors is relatively narrow and correlational, and it tends to produce very small effect sizes. The current article reviews the methodology of movie-smoking studies and analyzes their results meta-analytically. A total of 12 independent data sets were analyzed, which involved youth smoking behaviors as outcome (total participants = 70,788). Meta-analytic results suggested that, due to the large sample size of most studies, results often achieved “statistical significance” despite producing trivial effect sizes. Further, even these trivial effects may be due to widespread methodological limitations including demand characteristics and potential researcher expectancy effects. Recommendations are made for improving this research field.

"741","Experimental studies of human–robot interaction: Threats to valid interpretation from methodological constraints associated with experimental manipulations","AbstractThe rapid development of artificial intelligence brings with it the increasing likelihood of ubiquitous interaction between humans and robots. A significant contribution to studying human–robot interactions (HRI) comes from experimental studies, whereby humans and robots interact in controlled conditions and researchers observe and measure the reactions of humans (and robots). The use of experiments to understand human interactions has long been a central source of information in the field of experimental social psychology. These studies have yielded numerous major insights into the causes and outcomes of interaction. The methodology of experiments, however, including the demands made upon human participants to behave in predictable ways and the impact of experimenters’ expectancies upon results, has been a focus of much critical analysis. We examined a sample of 100 high impact HRI studies for evidence of potentially contaminating experimental artefacts and/or authors’ awareness of such factors. In our conclusions we highlight several methodological issues that appeared frequently in our sample, which may impede generalisations from laboratory experiments to real-world settings. Ultimately, we suggest that researchers may need to reformulate the methodologies used to study the unique features of HRI, and offer a number of recommendations for researchers designing HRI experiments.

In this Open Forum, the author used the findings from eight systematic reviews to critically evaluate the quality of the evidence for the effectiveness of such interventions. He found that trials of contact-based interventions lacked methodological rigor, reporting was biased toward positive results, the trials were subject to demand characteristics, no dose effects were observed, effects did not last, and no evidence supported behavior change. Standards for future trials are proposed and implications for reducing stigma and discrimination are discussed.

"743","Psychopathy subfactors distinctively predispose to dispositional and state-level of sadistic pleasure","Background and objectives: Sadistic pleasure—the enjoyment of harm-infliction to others—can have devastating interpersonal and societal consequences. The current knowledge on non-sexual, subclinical forms of sadistic pleasure is poor. The present study therefore focussed on the personality correlates of sadistic pleasure and investigated the relationship between the different subcomponents of psychopathy and both dispositional and state-level sadistic pleasure. Method: N = 120 males drawn from a community sample filled out questionnaires to assess their level of psychopathy and dispositional sadism. Then, participants engaged in a bug-grinder procedure in which they were led to believe that they were killing pill bugs. The positive affect they reported after ostensibly killing the bugs served as measures of sadistic pleasure. The bug-grinding task was repeated a second time after installing either a positive victim attitude combined with giving human names to the bugs, or a negative victim attitude combined with labeling the bugs with numbers. Results: Although the Self-centred Impulsivity component of psychopathy had some relevance to sadism, it was the Coldheartedness subscale that showed the strongest relationship to sadistic pleasure. Specifically, increased Coldheartedness was uniquely related to more positive affect, along with less guilt after bug grinding. Limitations: Drawbacks of the study include the unique reliance on a male, community sample, and the potential impact of demand characteristics, including a suggestion that the participant put at least some bugs into the grinder. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the differential predictive value of psychopathy components for sadistic pleasure. Coldheartedness can be considered especially disturbing because of its unique relationship to harm-infliction of the most irreversible nature (i.e. killing), and gaining pleasure out of it.

"744","Afterword: Advancing consultation practice","Although consultation and its analogue, interprofessional collaboration, have long been recognized professional competencies, the complexity of the roles across the various settings, demand characteristics, worldviews, and contexts had not been fully addressed. To fill this gap, the authors invited leaders in the respective fields of consultation to prepare chapters with the objective of providing an integrated, innovative competency-based approach for individuals in training or those considering expansion of practice. Consultation is increasingly described as an implementation strategy for evidence-based practice as a means to instill and support acquisition and application of knowledge, skills, and adherence to the model. As the role and efficacy of consultation are more widely understood and valued, training to address specific competencies is essential. Through a combination of course work attending to foundational and functional competencies and supervised experience in the field, psychology will enter a new era of expanded roles and competence in consultation.

"745","Reward for pain: Hyperalgesia and allodynia induced by operant conditioning: Systematic review and meta-analysis","Learning processes have been discussed in the context of pain chronicity for decades. Particularly, operant conditioning has been used to experimentally induce and modulate pain in healthy humans. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, research findings on pain facilitation (hyperalgesic effect) and pain elicitation (allodynic effect) are evaluated. The review was performed according to the PRISMA guideline and an a priori published protocol. Nine databases were searched for relevant publications: PubMed, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, ScienceDirect, EBSCO, PsycInfo (2022), MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, and CINAHL. Studies were included if they investigated pain-free humans, exposed to an operant conditioning procedure of pain. Two independent assessors screened publications against eligibility criteria and assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias scale. A total of 3155 records were screened, of which 8 were included in the qualitative (401 participants) and 5 into the quantitative (110 participants) synthesis. Results showed that hyperalgesic (standardized mean difference = -0.80, 95% confidence interval = -1.33 to -0.27, P = .003) and allodynic effects (standardized mean difference = -1.27, 95% confidence interval = -2.46 to -0.08, P = .04) can be induced in healthy humans, indicating that pain can be shaped by contingencies of reinforcement. However, the uncertainty of the effect is relatively high, mostly owing to the small number of included studies, demand characteristics, and the risk of bias. This is especially relevant for studies on allodynic effects where the decrease in nociception should be more rigorously controlled. Perspective: Operant conditioning can be a mechanism of pain chronicity. All experimental studies investigating this hypothesis have been identified and summarized. It has been demonstrated that allodynic and hyperalgesic effects can be induced by operant conditioning.

"747","Debunking the Stanford Prison Experiment","The Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE) is one of psychology’s most famous studies. It has been criticized on many grounds, and yet a majority of textbook authors have ignored these criticisms in their discussions of the SPE, thereby misleading both students and the general public about the study’s questionable scientific validity. Data collected from a thorough investigation of the SPE archives and interviews with 15 of the participants in the experiment further question the study’s scientific merit. These data are not only supportive of previous criticisms of the SPE, such as the presence of demand characteristics, but provide new criticisms of the SPE based on heretofore unknown information. These new criticisms include the biased and incomplete collection of data, the extent to which the SPE drew on a prison experiment devised and conducted by students in one of Zimbardo’s classes 3 months earlier, the fact that the guards received precise instructions regarding the treatment of the prisoners, the fact that the guards were not told they were subjects, and the fact that participants were almost never completely immersed by the situation. Possible explanations of the inaccurate textbook portrayal and general misperception of the SPE’s scientific validity over the past 5 decades, in spite of its flaws and shortcomings, are discussed.

"748","Character strengths of junior Australian Army officers","Introduction: Armed forces view their officers’ character as foundational to their ability to lead the personnel entrusted to them. The character of junior officers is of particular interest, because they must increasingly make quick, morally-laden decisions while dispersed among civilians without time to consult their commanders. However, little is systematically known about the character of officers. Accordingly, the present study was aimed at mapping Australian Army junior officers’ perceptions of the chief aspects of their own character and also those of their main role models, specifically, their senior officers, including their trustworthiness as an essential aspect of effective leadership. The present study also tested whether these character perceptions were aligned with four core values of the Australian Army—courage, initiative, teamwork, and respect – which are intended to shape the character of its personnel. Materials and Methods: The respondents ( N = 171 lieutenants) ranked how well each of 24 positive character strengths applied to themselves as individuals. To test the alignment of these rankings with the respondents’ perception of their leaders’ character, respondents nominated the five top strengths of their effective leaders. This study was approved by the Australian Defence Human Research Ethics Committee (ADHREC 009–2013). Results: With regard to the first aim, five character strengths—integrity, leadership, good judgment, trustworthy, and teamworker—were ranked by the respondents as being their chief personal strengths at frequencies significantly above those expected from random allocation. With regard to the second aim, the respondents aligned the rankings of their character strengths with those of their effective leaders through the entire list, not just the highest-ranking items. Nevertheless, there were two significant differences. The respondents assigned their leaders higher ranks for wisdom than for themselves, but assigned lower ranks to their leaders for being trustworthy. With regard to the third aim, the respondents’ perceptions of their chief character strengths were not well aligned with the four core values of the Australian Army. Teamworker was given a significant top ranking, but courage, initiative, and respectful were not. Thus, the respondents did not appear to respond according to organizational demand characteristics. Conclusions: The present study achieved its aims. First, it revealed five character strengths that junior officers in the Australian Army tended to see as their own chief strengths. Second, the junior officers saw their character strengths as aligned with those of their senior officers. By and large, this alignment extended across all the character strengths, regardless of their specific ranking. Subject to further experimental testing, this finding provides correlational evidence that junior officers may model their character on what they see in their senior officers. Third, in contrast, the junior officers’ rankings were not well aligned with the Australian Army’s stated core values. The junior officers saw teamworker as one of their chief strengths, but not courage, initiative, or respectful. This pattern does not imply that the junior officers rejected strengths as valuable but only that they are not among the junior officers’ own chief strengths.

"749","Dance like no one’s watching: The influence of demand characteristics when examining lineups via computer or in-person","Lineup administrators may inadvertently bias an eyewitness’ identification; as such, the blind-lineup administration is recommended to combat this bias. Three studies examined eyewitness identification accuracy when the lineup is presented on a computer versus in-person to determine whether computer-administrated lineups could replace in-person lineups to ensure blind administration. Study 1 ( N = 378) varied whether the administration was on a computer versus in-person across the simultaneous, elimination, and wildcard procedures. Overall, participants were more accurate when presented with the online administration; moreover, participants were more accurate in target-absent lineups when presented with a simultaneous or elimination procedure compared to the wildcard procedure. Study 2 ( N = 367) was similar to study 1 but used different stimuli and included the simultaneous, elimination, and elimination-plus procedures. Identification accuracy was comparable for online and in-person administration. Study 3 ( N = 219) sought to examine why online administration was superior in study 1 by varying whether the researcher was present only during the identification task. When the researcher was present, participants were more likely to make a foil identification in the simultaneous procedure compared to the elimination procedure. The results of these three studies suggest that computer-administrated lineups may be a feasible solution to ensure blind administration.

"750","Response latency methodology in consumer psychology","Response latency-based procedures can be used to make a wide variety of inferences about the cognitive processes of consumers. They can be used to assess processing ease, sensitivity to omissions, spontaneous judgment formation (for a wide variety of judgments, including attitudes, preferences, and inferences), associative strength, and mental image scanning. These procedures also provide a method of assessment that is quite different from standard self-report scales and greatly reduces concerns about demand characteristics and experimenter bias. For consumer researchers interested in mediation, response latencies provide useful mediational measures that reflect red cognitive operations, rather than mere manipulation checks. The author suspects that many of the highly counterintuitive findings reported in the leading consumer psychology journals are merely measurement effects that are unlikely to generalize to the field. Of course, this is an empirical issue. Using response latency-based procedures to assess the spontaneity with which different types of judgment are formed under different experimental conditions provides a useful diagnostic tool for testing this possibility.

"751","Is there a problem in the laboratory?","Problem-solving research in the field of psychology has been closely linked to laboratory investigations throughout its development. However, there is a questionable conceptual assumption underlying this commitment to the laboratory, namely the assumption that one can reduce all problem-solving behavior to a cognitive mechanism. Upon validating this assumption from a phenomenological standpoint, doubts about its foundations emerge. For when we consider the experiential conditions that characterize a problematic situation, we come to determine several phenomenal aspects that are not taken into account in this approach. A phenomenologically revised notion of the problem therefore demands a modification of the scope of the empirical research. First, this paper investigates the configuration of the laboratory as an arena of experience based on Lewin’s field theory. This investigation indicates instructions as a key component of the laboratory. Second, a phenomenological description proposes a novel understanding of the problem. In this part it is shown that it is wrong to presume that problematic situations can be evoked arbitrarily by instructions. Finally, further contemplations help outlining the empirical requirements for exhaustive research. They call for novel paradigms in empirical psychology, such as live streaming, which are more faithful to the phenomenology of problems.

"752","Unsolicited reports of voice hearing in the general population: A study using a novel method","Understanding the phenomenological range of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs), or voice hearing (VH) experiences, is important for developing etiological models. To circumvent potential methodological limitations of previous studies, we used unsolicited online self-reports to examine the kinds of experiences people describe when they say they hear voices. Content analysis was used to examine 499 online posts about VH, the largest VH sample studied to date. Most posters did not report having a psychiatric diagnosis. Unusual bodily sensations and third person voices were less prevalent than in previous studies. Volume of voices was mentioned significantly more often when voices were externally localized, but acoustic qualities were mentioned even when voices were internally localized. Some voice features previously considered atypical, such as unclear voices and voices that are not self-relevant, were described in almost 15% of coded posts. Only 21% described commanding voices, a feature previously considered typical of VH. Individuals sometimes reported voices both consistent with, and inconsistent with, inner speech accounts of VH. These results may have implications for subtyping AVHs. This novel method allowed description of a large sample of self-reports relatively untainted by demand characteristics or social desirability biases.

"753","The devil wears stata: Thin-ideal media’s minimal contribution to our understanding of body dissatisfaction and eating disorders","That media thinness (media depicting unrealistically thin actresses or models) contributes to female body dissatisfaction and, potentially, eating disorders has been often reported as established fact for decades. However, like many fields of psychology, particularly those linked to advocacy efforts, a gulf exists between the rhetoric used by some scholars and advocates, and the actual data available to support such claims. This article will document that the evidentiary base for media thinness effects is neither as consistent nor as high-quality as reported. Consistent methodological issues across many studies have increased the potential for spurious positive findings. Best practice approaches to reduce demand characteristics, ensure careful matching of experimental conditions, and control for other important variables in correlational studies are uncommon. Further, studies that do use best practices tend to return weaker evidence for effects. Although examples of good science in this field do exist, overall it may risk ideological rigidity, wherein advocacy goals are primary over careful examination of data. Suggestions for improvement are offered, along with recommendations that media research consider theories of consumer motivation rather than direct effects of content.

"754","Ethical issues in online research","The rapid adoption of the Internet by the general public over the past two decades has been accompanied by new ways of communicating, seeking, and sharing information. The proportion of the global population with Internet access has increased from less than 1 percent in 1995 to approximately 40 percent by the end of 2015. Accompanying this growth has been interest in using the Internet for research, with the first psychology online research studies recorded in the 1990s and the number of studies rapidly expanding since that time. The advantages of conducting research online, including access to specialized and hidden populations, potential savings in time and resources, and reduced demand characteristics, have resulted in a proliferation of online psychological studies employing quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methodologies. In this chapter, we provide four case studies designed to work through some of the ethical considerations previously outlined in preparing for and conducting psychological research in online contexts. The first case study, presenting a counseling psychologist preparing to undertake his first qualitative online study using passive data collection methods, focuses on distinguishing between private and public domains online and the resulting considerations on whether consent or copyright should be prioritized. The ethical issues in this first case study relate to the principle of respect for the autonomy and dignity of persons. The second case study, presenting a postdoctoral researcher engaging in qualitative, covert active data collection in online communities, explores issues related to researcher (non)identification, covert data collection methods and deception, and the potential impacts of these on groups and communities, addressing the principle of social responsibility. The third case study, presenting an academic planning to conduct an online quantitative survey using a commercial survey provider, explores ethical considerations when recruiting online and using commercial survey providers. Potential threats to survey respondents' anonymity, privacy, and consent processes, data protection, and scientific value are discussed. The final case study, presenting a Ph.D. student seeking supervisory advice on the protection of both the researcher and research participants for a planned online mixed methods research project on a sensitive topic, addresses the principle of maximizing benefits and minimizing harm. After each of the case studies, consideration of procedural ethics will be followed by an exploration of process ethics—potential issues during the research process that may require researcher reflexivity and further ethical consideration.

"755","Cognitive Behavior Therapy treatment fidelity in clinical trials: Review of recommendations","Background: Over a number of decades, Cognitive Behavior Therapy has evolved and been modified by various theorists and researchers. Concerns regarding the integrity of cognitive and behavioral treatment in research studies, including fidelity, competence, and treatment differentiation, have been raised. Ensuring adequate treatment fidelity and competency is a prerequisite to have a reliable measure of the independent variable and having confidence in the corresponding statistical conclusions. Objective: To review the extant literature on the topic of treatment fidelity and consolidate recommendations that would be relevant to researchers and practitioners of Cognitive Behavior Therapy. Results: Adequate fidelity data is not typically reported in psychotherapy outcome studies. This decreases confidence in the conclusions of these studies, and in the conclusions of meta-analytic analyses that involve these studies. Several studies have consistently demonstrated that assuming treatment fidelity or competence is problematic. Conclusion: Previous recommendations are compiled and reemphasized. Individual psychotherapists are encouraged to seek competency-based certifications (e.g., through the Academy of Cognitive Therapy) to verify competency and fidelity of Cognitive Behavior Therapy practice. Researchers are encouraged to utilize direct-observational methods to ensure fidelity of practice and reliability of the independent variable. Due to concerns about demand characteristics and possible inflation of fidelity estimates, it is strongly recommended that expertly trained, blind raters who are not dependent on the project or organization be used to assess the fidelity and competency of clinical practice. Additionally, it is recommended that journal editors require inclusion of fidelity data from manuscripts that are seeking publication.

"756","Ethikkonsultation oder psychologische Supervision? Kasuistische und methodische Reflexionen zu einem ungeklärten Verhältnis","Definition of the problem: The relationship between ethics consultation (EC) and psychological supervision (PS), established, for example, in the psychiatric context or palliative care, has received little investigation. This amounts to a research gap on the specific practice of the two approaches that contributes to an uncertainty or even conceptual lack of clarity in the perception of both users and—partly—providers, especially regarding possible indication criteria. In this paper, we will study commonalities and differences of EC and PS as well as their methodological and practical characteristics by mutually referring to two clinical case examples from both approaches also highlighting emerging contrasts. Reasoning and results: As a result of the case-based and methodological analysis, distinctive criteria are presented. These include the following: (1) objectives of each approach, (2) access and demand characteristics, (3) content, (4) focus, (5) methodology, (6) role of consultant/counsellor, (7) results, (8) documentation, (9) working with emotions, (10) explicit reference to ethical issues. Conclusions: While articulating an overlap identified and illustrated in the comparison between EC and PS and the respective case studies, we conclude that the two approaches should not be regarded as mutually exchangeable. Rather, we suggest that any mixture or combination of both cannot be recommended as this might lead to watering down the specificity of each approach and its respective strengths. Furthermore, preliminary suggestions are offered for the specific indication of EC or PS covering also pragmatic considerations such as the particular motivation of participants and the immediate availability of service.

"757","Social and contextual constraints on embodied perception","A number of papers have challenged research on physiological and psychological influences on perception by claiming to show that such findings can be explained by nonperceptual factors such as demand characteristics. Relatedly, calls for separating perception from judgment have been issued. However, such efforts fail to consider key processes known to shape judgment processes: people’s inability to report accurately on their judgments, conversational dynamics of experimental research contexts, and misattribution and discounting processes. Indeed, the fact that initially observed effects of embodied influences disappear is predicted by an extensive amount of literature on judgments studied within social psychology. Thus, findings from such studies suggest that the initially presumed underlying processes are at work—namely, functional considerations that are informative in the context of preparing the body for action. In this article, I provide suggestions on how to conduct research on perception within the social constraints of experimental contexts.

Thus, subjects’ ability to so accurately articulate the experimental hypotheses, she argues, can be safely ignored.

"761","Frightened by an old scarecrow: The remarkable resilience of demand characteristics","More than 50 years ago, the idea of demand characteristics was introduced by Martin Orne in a widely cited American Psychologist article. Through the 1960s and the mid-1970s, numerous studies were conducted investigating the role of demand characteristics in a variety of research areas. Demand characteristics faded from researchers’ attention in the late 1970s, relegated to brief descriptions in research methods textbooks. The present article traces the origins of and battles fought over demand characteristics during its heyday. Evidence is provided that suggests demand characteristics experienced a rebirth in the 1980s and it remains a widely referenced idea up to today. Demand characteristics reflect perennial concerns about the difficulties of and limitations to doing research with humans, concerns that often surface in the periodic crises that confront psychology. The types of problems that animated the crisis of confidence associated with demand characteristics in the 1970s form one dimension of the current replication crisis. Reinterpretation of this current replication crisis and a new direction for experimental research with human subjects are derived from this review of demand characteristics.

"762","Psilocybin: Psychotherapy or drug?","Comments on an article by Stephen Ross et al. (see record 2016-58838-002) &amp; Roland R Griffiths et al. (see record 2016-58838-003). This edition of the Journal of Psychopharmacology highlights two very similarly designed studies of the effects of the serotonergic agonist psilocybin on the psychological distress of cancer patients. Psilocybin produced an acute increase in blood pressure and a variety of immediate and obvious subjective effects. The subjective effects were transient and did not lead to persisting abnormal perceptions. The outcome measures of both trials are entirely subjective, comprising self, community and clinician reports, just as most studies of antidepressants and anxiolytics have been. While this is understandable, it is a particular weakness of any study where blinding is inadequate. Any cue that makes participants in an experimental study aware of what the experimenter expects to find or how participants are expected to behave is called a demand characteristic. These studies have demand characteristics in spades. Just as for other studies, symptoms alone are also a limited way of assessing the value of treatment: more objective measures of activity, simply motor or economic, the costs of their cancer care and so on should also be part of the future picture for research in this area.

"763","Proposed applications of research on action-specific effects are premature","Comments on an article by Jessica K. Witt, Sally A. Linkenauger &amp; Chris Wickens (see record 2016-13574-008). Witt et al. briefly mentioned indirect measures and gave an example of their use. Few of the published studies in this area employ indirect measures to rule out the influence of demand characteristics and other factors that act on judgment rather than perception. As an example of applying action-specific effects in rehabilitation treatment, Witt et al. proposed that “increases in distance perception can be used as an indicator of recovery and a converging measure of the patient’s perceptions of the recovery of their action capabilities”. They then go on to say with regard to prosthetic limbs that “Perceived distance and size could act as an objective measure of patients’ perceptions of the limb’s usefulness”. Aside from the matter of whether action-effects exist, it seems strange to consider reports of perception as “objective measures” and doubtful that rehabilitation practitioners would find such reports useful when verbal reports of the limb’s usefulness and objective measures of improved behavioral ability and fluency are available.

"764","Toward a science of internal experience: Conceptual and methodological issues in hypnosis and meditation research","Hypnosis and meditation both involve private, subjective experiences. As a result, they can be difficult to investigate in empirical studies. This chapter discusses some of the theoretical and methodological challenges in conducting such research, and ways of addressing these. It focuses, in particular, on four conceptual issues in hypnosis research that the authors believe might also be useful in studying meditation. These are: distinguishing the procedures participants follow from their reported effects; separating participants' trait capacities and contextual influences; considering the interplay between cognitive and social processes; and controlling for demand characteristics. The chapter notes how awareness of these issues may enrich understanding of meditation and help guide research into subjective experience more broadly.

"765","Practitioner review: Cognitive bias modification for mental health problems in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis","Background Despite accumulating research and bold claims about the efficacy of cognitive bias modification (CBM) for young populations, no meta-analysis has attempted to synthesize the research literature so far. We examined whether there was empirical evidence for the clinical efficacy of CBM interventions in youths, while also considering the methodological quality of this evidence. Methods Studies were identified through systematic searches in bibliographical databases (PubMed, PsychInfo, Cochrane Library and EMBASE to June 2014). We included randomized controlled trials of CBM interventions, and considered both clinical outcomes and targeted biases. We examined the quality of the trials, as well as potential publication bias and possible moderators. Results We identified 23 trials that reported on four types of outcomes: mental health, anxiety, depression and bias. Effect sizes were small and nonsignificant for all symptom outcomes considered. We found a moderate significant effect size for bias outcomes (Hedges' g of 0.53), with significant heterogeneity. There were no differences between types of CBM interventions, or between one versus multiple-session applications. A small but significant effect size for mental health problems arose when the intervention was delivered in schools. The quality of almost all of the included studies was suboptimal and the vast majority did not include information needed for allowing quality assessment. Conclusions We conducted the first meta-analysis of CBM interventions for children and adolescents and found no effects for mental health outcomes, but we did find moderate and significant effects on the targeted biases. Our results cast serious doubts on CBM interventions having any clinical utility for nonadult populations. Demand characteristics might play an important part in CBM research.

"766","Dual pathways to prospective remembering","According to the multiprocess framework (McDaniel and Einstein, 2000), the cognitive system can support prospective memory (PM) retrieval through two general pathways. One pathway depends on top–down attentional control processes that maintain activation of the intention and/or monitor the environment for the triggering or target cues that indicate that the intention should be executed. A second pathway depends on (bottom–up) spontaneous retrieval processes, processes that are often triggered by a PM target cue; critically, spontaneous retrieval is assumed not to require monitoring or active maintenance of the intention. Given demand characteristics associated with experimental settings, however, participants are often inclined to monitor, thereby potentially masking discovery of bottom–up spontaneous retrieval processes. In this article, we discuss parameters of laboratory PM paradigms to discourage monitoring and review recent behavioral evidence from such paradigms that implicate spontaneous retrieval in PM. We then re-examine the neuro-imaging evidence from the lens of the multiprocess framework and suggest some critical modifications to existing neurocognitive interpretations of the neuro-imaging results. These modifications illuminate possible directions and refinements for further neuro-imaging investigations of PM.

In general, results revealed minimal coverage of problems with the study, with only two of the 14 textbooks citing any critical articles. The majority of textbooks presented the study in a fashion consistent with a “power of the situation” interpretation with no account of a more theoretically robust study, namely the BBC prison study, nor mention of methodological shortcomings.

"770","Selecting the best supply chain strategy: When is a misalignment of product type and strategy appropriate, how do changes in expected demand impact strategies, and should the strategy of a product change over its life-cycle?","To reduce the total cost of delivering a product to the marketplace, many firms are going beyond the walls of their organization and working with suppliers and customers to implement supply chain management (SCM). Fisher (1997) presented a conceptual model contending that the demand characteristics and supply chain strategy (SCS) of a product should be aligned for SCM to be successful. This dissertation presents an original analytical model of a three echelon supply chain to demonstrate under various supply chain conditions that a ""misalignment"" between demand characteristics and SCS can result in a lower total supply chain cost. In addition to Fisher (1997), the literature includes a number of SCS frameworks to assist practitioners with identifying the appropriate SCS. However, none have considered a SCS where the supply side employs an agile strategy and demand side utilizes a lean strategy; which is denoted as an ""agilean"" SCS. This dissertation considers four possible supply chain strategies (lean, agile, leagile, and agilean) and identifies when each SCS type is most effective at minimizing total supply chain cost. The demand characteristics of a product typically evolve as a product progresses through its life-cycle. The literature presents two views concerning whether the SCS of a product should evolve as the product progresses through its life-cycle. This dissertation demonstrates that a single SCS employed over the life-cycle of a product is generally a more effective SCS to minimize total supply chain cost over the life-cycle of a product than evolving the product's SCS as it progresses through its life-cycle.

"771","From question-behaviour effects in trials to the social psychology of research participation","The ‘question-behaviour effect’ (QBE) has attracted much recent attention within health psychology, where it has also been referred to as the ‘mere measurement’ effect. There are other conceptualisations of similar phenomena in related disciplines. This paper explores the implications of the QBE for the safety of inferences about intervention effectiveness within the context of randomised controlled trials evaluating health behaviour change interventions. It draws attention to poorly understood mechanisms by which bias is introduced with conventional thinking about trial design and analysis. The threat to valid inference on intervention effectiveness posed by the QBE applies even when its effects are small and regardless of the specific content of the QBE. The nature of the resulting bias does not fit well within existing bias classification schemes, such as that proposed by the Cochrane Collaboration. The QBE is one possible consequence of research participation and it is suggested that the social psychology of research participation is very much underdeveloped. Possible future directions for health psychology research in this area are considered.

"775","Hypnosis and cognition","This article summarizes the contributions of hypnosis to our understanding of cognition. These contributions have been especially salient in the study of memory, and include source amnesia and the distinction between episodic and semantic memory; the occurrence of semantic priming in implicit (unconscious) memory; and paramnesia (false memory). Posthypnotic amnesia shows that explicit and implicit memory can be dissociated even under optimal encoding conditions. The hypnotic alterations of perception may expand the scope of central executive control over “low-level” sensory and perceptual processes, and offer a new perspective on perceptual couplings. Implicit (unconscious) perception in hypnosis is not subject to the same analytic limitations encountered in masked priming. In the study of “high-level” thought processes, hypnosis has played an important role in understanding the formation of delusional beliefs, and of intuitions in problem-solving. Studies of hypnosis suggest that automatic processes can be “de-automatized,” as in the reversal of Stroop interference by suggestions for hypnotic agnosia. In social cognition, Orne’s analysis of demand characteristics laid the foundations for the cognitive revolution in social psychology, by underscoring the status of subjects—and people outside the laboratory—as active, sentient, problem-solving agents. The search for correlates of hypnotizability led to the incorporation of openness to experience as a major cognitive dimension in the structure of personality. One topic for future research is the relationship between hypnotizability in children and their development of a theory of mind. Studies of hypnosis in children may shed new light on the development of the imagination.

"776","Using politeness to model the psychosocial dynamics of power in organizational interaction","Purpose: The purpose is to show how actors' relative power or parity is dynamically instanced in discrete speech behaviors that are exchanged throughout everyday organizational interaction. Design/methodology/approach: Politeness theory, rooted in the dramaturgical theories of Erving Goffman, details a set of linguistic indices used to show regard for others' face. This conceptual paper draws on politeness theory to model the unfolding of power relations within face-to-face verbal interchange in organizations. The paper presents a number of propositions suggesting how power differentials (or parity) are reflected in a set of common speech behaviors used to defray threats to face throughout organizational interaction. Findings: This article extends and applies politeness theory to organizations by exploring specific motives and linguistic outcomes of high and low power actors, describing the behavioral egalitarianism associated with organic organizations, and suggesting how the demand characteristics of face-to-face interaction create oligarchic tendencies that militate against the success of workplace participation. Politeness' role in the social construction of power, and in distortive processes within hierarchical communication, is also discussed. Research limitations/implications: This paper enables researchers to understand the specific linguistic features associated with power-related roles, and it shows how the social distribution of certain speech behaviors is a function of power and dependency relations. Practical implications: The findings provide managers a fine-grained understanding of how power affects speech, and an understanding of how such speech patterns may stymie attempts to stimulate organizational empowerment and employee voice. Originality/value: Prior scholarship has neglected this most important topic.

As the title suggests, the book critically analyzes media effects literatures, including the influence of crime shows on juror expectations, violent media on aggression and criminal violence, and viewing pornography on the likelihood of committing rape. The book places a focus on legal cases pertaining to media effects. Thoughtful, objective criticism in any area of research can be a tool for refining methods and conclusions, but the current book fails in this regard. The reviewers note that numerous publications have addressed common criticisms of media effects research and have found those criticisms to be logically and/or empirically invalid. Nonetheless, this book largely repeats long-discredited criticisms without indicating how they have been addressed. Word limits preclude detailed discussion of each criticism raised in the book, but the review pays special attention to methodological criticisms, including issues of validity, demand characteristics, and standardization of aggression measurements. Further, the reviewers note the difficulties in interpreting broad sociological data when one is addressing questions regarding psychological phenomena (e.g., the influence of violent media on aggression, the influence of pornography viewership on rape). The review also focuses on interpretation of effect sizes within media effects research. Emphasis is placed on understanding media effects within the risk and resilience approach. Additional errors, omissions, and misrepresentations of media effects research and theory are also discussed.

We report a content analysis of the method section of experiments reported in two psychology journals ( Psychological Science and the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology ), focusing on aspects of the procedure associated with these two phenomena, such as mention of the presence of the experimenter, suspicion probing, and handling of deception. We note that such information is very often absent, which prevents observers from gauging the extent to which such factors influence the results. We consider the reasons that may explain this omission, including the automatization of psychology experiments, the evolution of research topics, and, most important, a view of research participants as passive receptacles of stimuli. Using a situated social cognition perspective, we emphasize the importance of integrating the social context of experiments in the explanation of psychological phenomena. We illustrate this argument via a controversy on stereotype-based behavioral priming effects.

At this important, early stage of video game research, reducing the likelihood of false positive findings is essential.

"783","Hypersomnia","This issue of Sleep Medicine Clinics focuses on hypersomnia which is conventionally defined as an inability to consistently attain and sustain wakefulness and alertness necessary to meet the demands and accomplish the tasks of daily living. This definition, however, poses major challenges to a clinician who attempts to establish its presence and grade its severity. Needless to say, it is essential to distinguish among hypersomnia in which alertness mechanisms fail, leading to potentially dangerous sleep attacks, weak alerting systems in which a sleepy person has to put extra effort to stay awake and overactive sleep promoting processes. Hypersomnia can manifest in various ways, such as frequent napping, sleep attacks, microsleep episodes, automatic behavior, or hyperactivity. Depending on cultural perceptions, employer expectations, career ambitions, domestic apprehensions, personal agenda, and demand characteristics, a pattern of hypersomnia can be regarded as normal or problematic.

"784","Assessing mental skill and technique use in applied interventions: Recognizing and minimizing threats to the psychometric properties of the TOPS","Drawing from the experiences of the authors in developing, conducting, and evaluating sport psychology interventions, several considerations are highlighted and recommendations offered for effective psychometric assessment. Using the Test of Performance Strategies (TOPS; Thomas, Murphy, &amp; Hardy, 1999) as a working example, opportunities for bias to undermine a measure’s validity and reliability are discussed with reference to a respondent’s four cognitive processes: (a) comprehension, (b) retrieval, (c) decision-making, and (d) response generation. Further threats to an instrument’s psychometric properties are highlighted in the form of demand characteristics athletes perceive in the environment. With these concerns in mind, several recommendations are made relating to the process of questionnaire administration and how possible compromises to the psychometric soundness of measures used in applied interventions can be minimized.

(see record 2010-06920-007). We recently showed that palm board measures are systematically inaccurate for full-cue surfaces within reach of one's hand, whereas free-hand gestures and reaching actions are quite accurate for such surfaces (Durgin, Hajnal, Li, Tonge, &amp; Stigliani, 2010). Proffitt and Zadra (2010) claim that our demonstration that palm boards are highly inaccurate is irrelevant to interpreting past and present findings concerning dissociations between verbal reports and palm board estimates. In their paper they offer a theoretical representation of the findings of Bhalla and Proffitt (1999) and argue that our analysis is incompatible with their account. We offer here an alternative account of the findings of Bhalla and Proffitt, based on their actual data (which are fully compatible with our original analysis). We further show how our account generalizes to more recent studies that continue (1) to mistakenly describe null statistical effects on (insensitive) palm boards as evidence of a “dissociation” from (more sensitive) verbal measures that show a similar relative magnitude of change and (2) to introduce uncontrolled demand characteristics.

"786","Human consciousness and its relationship to social neuroscience: A novel hypothesis","A common modern view of consciousness is that it is an emergent property of the brain, perhaps caused by neuronal complexity, and perhaps with no adaptive value. Exactly what emerges, how it emerges, and from what specific neuronal process, are in debate. One possible explanation of consciousness, proposed here, is that it is a construct of the social perceptual machinery. Humans have specialized neuronal machinery that allows them to be socially intelligent. The primary role of this machinery is to construct models of other people’s minds thereby gaining some ability to predict the behavior of other individuals. In the present hypothesis, awareness is a perceptual reconstruction of attentional state; and the machinery that computes information about other people’s awareness is the same machinery that computes information about our own awareness. The present paper brings together a variety of lines of evidence, including experiments on the neural basis of social perception, on hemispatial neglect, on the out-of-body experience, on mirror neurons, and on the mechanisms of decision-making, to explore the possibility that awareness is a construct of the social machinery in the brain.

"787","Demand characteristics and quality improvement: Who is fooling whom?","Since some of the data used for quality assurance purposes (i.e. rating scales) requires the active participation of clinicians, administrators use various mandates or incentives to insure its collection. However, although improving clinician compliance these measures may bias clinician responses. It is suggested that the concept of ‘demand characteristics’ originally developed by Orne to describe how non-specific aspects of the experimental setting shape what the human subject does may be applicable. For example a measure that might increase clinician compliance with completing GAF ratings on an inpatient unit might also influence the scores to make them coincide with the expectation that all patients are very ill when admitted and improved when discharged. Why such a phenomenon would be difficult to detect and what it might say about the relationship between managers and those they manage is also explored.

"788","Psychological vulnerabilities during police interviews: Why are they important?","Over the past three decades much has been learned about the role and importance of psychological vulnerabilities in the context of unreliability of information obtained during police interviews. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge and explains why vulnerabilities are important. Psychological vulnerabilities are best construed as potential ‘risk factors’ rather than definitive markers of unreliability. They are important, because they may place witnesses, victims, and suspects at a disadvantage in terms of coping with the demand characteristics of the interview (and subsequent Court process) and being able to provide the police with salient, detailed, accurate, and coherent answers to questions. Early identification of relevant and pertinent vulnerabilities in the interview process helps to ensure fairness and justice. Currently, the identification of vulnerabilities is poor, and even when identified, they are not always acted upon. Nevertheless, England has taken the lead in improving the police interview process and the protection of vulnerable interviewees. More work needs to be done, but the Bradley Report recommendations represent an excellent opportunity for police and health care professionals to work together to improve justice for all. This is the key initial interface that will be vital for reducing future miscarriages of justice.

"789","Indirect perceptual, cognitive, and behavioural measures","The aim of this chapter is to review a number of perceptual, cognitive, and behavioural (indirect) measures of affect that may help us understand musical emotions. The chapter is organized as follows. First, the problems and limitations of self-report are described. Two main problems, demand characteristics and limited access to one own's internal processes, are discussed. Following this, the logic of indirect measures of affect is outlined, along with a set of definitions. This section also features a conceptual model of affective responding, which aims to facilitate distinctions and integration between different classes of indirect measures. The subsequent section describes seven classes of indirect measures and provides detailed examples of each class. It is the intention that the reader should get an understanding of the basics of each measure, along with ideas of how to implement them in their own research on music and emotion. Many of the reviewed measures are from non-musical domains, but, whenever possible, a description is provided that will enable use in a musical context. The chapter ends with a brief summary and conclusions.

"790","In with the old, in with the new: Capabilities, strategies, and performance among the Hollywood studios","An increased focus on turbulent environments has led to a growing interest among researchers in the concept of dynamic capabilities. In this study, we approach dynamic capabilities in a framework of two complementary processes. On one hand, firms can build upon existing capabilities in products and markets in which they have experienced recent success; on the other hand, they can also intentionally focus on other products and markets in which they seek to build capabilities to address their lack of recent success. We examine these two processes within project-based industries and identify replication and renewal as two types of strategies that firms use to add a dynamic component to their capabilities. We also theorize that the success of each of these strategies is tied to differentiation from rivals, and to firm-level resource availability and industry-level demand characteristics. We test these propositions by focusing on the film genres that were offered by the Hollywood studios over a thirty-year period.

Olfactory experiments are compared to behavioral neuroscience experiments in which a sham operation is used as a control condition. These comparisons point out the difficulty of using no-odor control conditions in olfactory experiments since they cannot provide adequate context for assessing nonspecific treatment effects. Demand characteristics in olfactory experiments are also discussed, and nomenclature is introduced to help guide the process of selecting good control conditions. In addition, a discussion of the selection of appropriate odors for control conditions is presented along with suggestions for strategies to create better olfactory experiments.

"794","Methodological problems associated with research on unfair discrimination against racial minorities","Despite the passage of civil rights legislation, racial and ethnic minorities continue to experience unfair discrimination in the workplace. Therefore, considerable research in human resource management and social psychology has examined the factors thought to affect unfair discrimination in organizations [Cox, T. (1993). Cultural diversity in organizations: Theory, research, and practice . San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler]. Although research has focused on unfair discrimination, researchers have argued that the construct and external validity of the results have been adversely affected by methodological problems [e.g., Stone, E.F., Stone, D.L., &amp; Dipboye, R.L. (1992). Stigmas in organizations: Race, handicaps, and physical unattractiveness. In Kelly, K. (Ed.). Issues, theory, and research in industrial and organizational psychology (pp. 385-457). Amsterdam: Elsevier]. Given this critique, the present paper (a) examines the degree to which recent research suffered from a number of methodological problems (e.g., obtrusive measures, non-representative samples, and demand characteristics), (b) identifies strategies for overcoming these problems, and (c) offers recommendations for advancing our understanding of unfair discrimination in organizational contexts.

"795","Research artifacts and the social psychology of psychological experiments","In psychological research with human subjects, experimenters need to anticipate potential artifacts that may be attributable to the social context of such research. Called research artifacts in this review, they are essentially uncontrolled, systematic errors (or biases) that threaten the degree of validity of statements made about whether changes in one variable result in changes in another variable. This discussion focuses on a proposed Markov-like model emphasizing three mediating variables that operate in a theoretical chain of events. One variable refers to the likelihood of the subject's receptivity to task-orienting cues (called demand characteristics ), or incidental hints about the experimenter's expectations. A second variable refers to the likelihood of the subjects motivation (or willingness) to comply with those cues or hints. A third variable refers to the likelihood of the subject's capability of responding in accordance with the cues or hints. These three variables are discussed along with strategies that researchers can use to break the chain of events.

"796","Options, contracts, and exogenous prices in applied revenue management","Revenue management is a concept used by airlines, hotels, and car rental firms in the selling of their limited service capacity. While the concept has its origin in the airline industry, due to its effectiveness, it has gradually been adopted by firms in other product and service sectors which have similar demand characteristics. A common assumption in the revenue management literature is that the firm has monopolist pricing power. In many practical settings this assumption does not match reality. In many industries that have adopted revenue management, relative pricing matters, with firms aggressively price-matching or underpricing to gain market share; price promotions are quickly replicated in these markets. Online sales have also contributed to firms' increasing price pressures, as consumers have a simple ways to evaluate their purchasing options. Many markets are simply more efficient at disseminating product and price information than they were in the past. The manuscripts in Chapters 2, 3, and 4, consider revenue management contexts in which exogenous price forces are modeled explicitly. Chapter 2 considers a car rental setting, in which the firm is a price-taker, meeting demand at market prices. In this study, the rental company is considering a low-price guarantee to help manage their demand channels, and the cost of the promotion is valued using a real options methodology. Chapter 3 formulates a model for a low-cost provider that must underprice another firm to capture exogenous demand. An optimal underpricing control policy is developed for a deterministic model, and is extended to the case of stochastic exogenous price and demand via a dynamic programming methodology. Chapter 4 considers a competitive procurement and pricing model relevant to tour operators and their service providers. This work considers a service supply chain in which a single service provider distributes their limited capacity to a number of resellers through price contracts. The optimal procurement and reselling prices are examined using game-theoretic and numerical methods.

"801","Balance on Coping","Reviews the book, Patterns of Adjustment and Human Effectiveness by Richard S. Lazarus (see record 1969-35001-000). The reviewer's initial thought, in beginning to read Lazarus's rather weighty tome, was that this is a massive effort directed at an audience that no longer exists. General courses in adjustment or 'mental hygiene' have tended to vanish from the curriculums of universities during, the past couple of decades. This has taken place, as Lazarus himself points out, because the typical mental hygiene course consisted of little more than a set of trite, bromidic and ""inspirational"" lectures on ""how to live."" The facts are, however, that Lazarus has produced a well-rounded, well-balanced and basically scholarly text, which does a very skillful job of presenting the current state of knowledge and opinion on the problems of human adaptation--and there should be a use for it. The book is in no sense trite, far from undemanding, and not at all ""inspirational."" The most insistent impression one gains from reading Patterns of Adjustment and Human Effectiveness is its degree of balance. He also displays a good deal of balance in his presentation of theory. On the whole, however, balance among alternatives remains Lazarus's major theme. He gives very adequate space to the demand characteristics of environments, as well as to intraindividual determinants. The literary style is far from lively but is clear and straightforward.

"802","Variables in experimental games: Toward a field theory","Experimental studies of gaming have dealt with task, situational, and personality variables. Most studies have focused on either dyadic matrix games (with the Prisoner's Dilemma as a prototype) or triadic competitive games (with the Board Game as a prototype). Types of variables in each category are: (1) task variables matrix variations, mode of presentation, length of run, threat, and power relationships; (2) situational variables strategy variations, instructions, feedback and communication, character of opponent, and reward; and (3) personality variables general differences between Ss, family background, psychopathology, attitudes and traits, and motives. In dyadic games, level of cooperation is significantly influenced by conditions in all 3 categories. In triadic games, similarly, all 3 classes of variables influence coalition formation, strategy, and outcomes. The following problems arise: comparison of game-situations, effects of situational constraints, demand characteristics, relevance to social interaction, relevance of variables, interactional effects, and variations in group size. Strictly rational theories emphasize task (and situational) variables, in contrast to theories which emphasize perceptual, cognitive, and motivational processes (personality and situational) variables. Neither kind of theory is sufficient, and a field theory is preferable. (4 p. ref.) (PsycInfo (2022) Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","N/A","N/A","0","1",NA,"Vinacke, W.

Objective, standardized susceptibility scales have provided adequate measurement, leading to the differentiation of hypnotic from waking behavior, and recognition that hypnotic phenomena are multifactorial. Social-psychological factors (demand characteristics) influence experimental results and special control procedures have been developed to evaluate the essentially subjective nature of hypnosis. Experimental evidence relating to the ""motivational theory"" of hypnosis does not provide support for this approach. Several studies are reviewed covering posthypnotic suggestion and amnesia, and counter-expectational effects of hypnosis which cannot be attributed to the demand characteristics of the experimental context (trance logic, source amnesia, posthypnotic behavior occurring outside the experimental context, and the nontermination of hypnosis following the ""disappearance"" of the hypnotist).

The available evidence warrants three conclusions: (a) persons entering cults do not necessarily exhibit psychopathology; (b) current cult members appear psychologically well-adjusted generally, and demonstrate few conspicuous symptoms of psychopathology. However, pathology may be masked by conformity pressures and demand characteristics associated with the cultic environment; (c) a small but growing body of research indicates that at least a substantial minority of former cult members experience significant adjustment difficulties. There also are indications that these difficulties cannot be ascribed to demand characteristics. Although this review highlights definitional and methodological issues and problems that temper conclusions that can be drawn from the literature, no evidence indicates that cults improve adjustment after members leave the cultic environment.

The correlational nature of the study is criticized: ss may have developed the notion that the guns had affected their behavior after they had acted, in part, at least, because the intensive postexperimental interview had put this idea in their mind. The demand-characteristic notion is examined, and it is pointed out that there is very little evidence that ss are motivated to confirm the e's hypothesis if they are free of evaluation apprehension and do not fear the e's disapproval.

"845","The ""good subject"" in verbal operant conditioning research","Assigned 23 volunteer and 22 nonvolunteer undergraduate females to a standard Taffel conditioning procedure in which the E's use of the word ""good"" ostensibly serves as a verbal reinforcement for the S's emission of ""I"" or ""we"" responses. Half of each group was explicitly informed as to the exact nature of the treatment. It was hypothesized that volunteers, owing to their presumably higher approval need and greater willingness to comply with coercive demands, would admit to a stronger inclination to produce the desired response class and show a greater propensity for conditioning than nonvolunteers. It was also expected that the demand characteristics in this situation being comparatively simple and straightforward, only negligible differences in the perception of those demands would be reported by informed vs naive Ss. All of the hypotheses received strong support. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical and methodological implications for an understanding of the social psychology of this popular verbal conditioning procedure. (31 ref.)

"850","Further evidence for mixed emotions.","Emotion theorists have long debated whether valence, which ranges from pleasant to unpleasant states, is an irreducible aspect of the experience of emotion or whether positivity and negativity are separable in experience. If valence is irreducible, it follows that people cannot feel happy and sad at the same time. Conversely, if positivity and negativity are separable, people may be able to experience such mixed emotions. The authors tested several alternative interpretations for prior evidence that happiness and sadness can co-occur in bittersweet situations (i.e., those containing both pleasant and unpleasant aspects). One possibility is that subjects who reported mixed emotions merely vacillated between happiness and sadness. The authors tested this hypothesis in Studies 1-3 by asking subjects to complete online continuous measures of happiness and sadness. Subjects reported more simultaneously mixed emotions during a bittersweet film clip than during a control clip. Another possibility is that subjects in earlier studies reported mixed emotions only because they were explicitly asked whether they felt happy and sad. The authors tested this hypothesis in Studies 4-6 with open-ended measures of emotion. Subjects were more likely to report mixed emotions after the bittersweet clip than the control clip. Both patterns occurred even when subjects were told that they were not expected to report mixed emotions (Studies 2 and 5) and among subjects who did not previously believe that people could simultaneously feel happy and sad (Studies 3 and 6). These results provide further evidence that positivity and negativity are separable in experience.","N/A","N/A","1","N/A","Found personally; Study 2 is not eligible because the demand manipulation was confounded with assigned clip.

One of these problems that exists in almost all schools is the phenomenon of school bullying. The aim of this study is to examine the psychometric reliability and validity of the Participant Role Scale in bullying in Persian and compare the psychometric properties of 3- and 4-factorial models for this scale.We use both descriptive and inferential statistics. The statistical population was the second-grade students in Lorestan province in the year 2021–2022. Sample size of 617 students (324 males and 293 females) were selected by multistage cluster sampling. The range of Subscales Cronbach’s alpha coefficients varied from 0.8 to 0.91, and the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the whole scale was 0.90. The 3-factorial model had slightly better reliability than the 4-factorial model structure. Similarly, the factor structure of the 3-factorial model structure was much better in exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. We provide a reliable and valid 3-factorial model for the Participant Role Scale in Persian.

"852","Unveiling the invisible: Receivers use object weight cues for grip force planning in handover actions","Handover actions are part of our daily lives. Whether it is the milk carton at the breakfast table or tickets at the box office, we usually perform these joint actions without much conscious attention. The individual actions involved in handovers, that have already been studied intensively at the level of individual actions, are grasping, lifting, and transporting objects. Depending on the object’s properties, actors must plan their execution in order to ensure smooth and efficient object transfer. Therefore, anticipatory grip force scaling is crucial. Grip forces are planned in anticipation using weight estimates based on experience or visual cues. This study aimed to investigate whether receivers are able to correctly estimate object weight by observing the giver’s kinematics. For this purpose, handover actions were performed with 20 dyads, manipulating the participant role (giver/receiver) and varying the size and weight of the object. Due to the random presentation of the object weight and the absence of visual cues, the participants were unaware of the object weight from trial to trial. Kinematics were recorded with a motion tracking system and grip forces were recorded with customized test objects. Peak grip force rates were used as a measure of anticipated object weight. Results showed that receiver kinematics are significantly affected by object weight. The peak grip force rates showed that receivers anticipate object weight, but givers not. This supports the hypothesis that receivers obtain information about the object weight by observing giver’s kinematics and integrating this information into their own action execution.

"853","Impact of a pre-test measurement of alcohol craving in cue-exposure studies: Relationship with social desirability and demand effects","Craving is one of the most studied concepts in the field of addiction. It is often investigated with repeated-measure experimental designs using self-reported scales. However, the explicit nature of self-reported craving scales may make them vulnerable to social desirability and demand effects. The aim of the present study was to test whether a pre-experimental measurement of craving affects its post-experimental assessment after an alcohol video exposure and whether these changes relate to social desirability, demand effects, and alcohol consumption. Seventy-five healthy volunteers aged 18–30 years were randomly assigned to two experimental groups: a pre-post and a post-only craving assessment group. They were invited to watch an alcohol-related video. Social desirability, demand effects, engagement toward the video, and severity of alcohol consumption were assessed in all participants. The results showed a significant effect of alcohol consumption ( p &lt; .001, <U+03B7>²p = .09) on post-experimental craving. The main effect of the repeated measure of craving was also significant ( p = .04, <U+03B7>²p = .001), together with the interaction between these two variables ( p = .03, <U+03B7>² p = .06). The pre-experimental craving measurement increased its post-experimental levels, but only in heavy drinkers. However, no evidence was found that these changes were related to social desirability or demand effects. Additional exploratory analyses indicated that craving increase in high alcohol drinkers was mediated by a stronger engagement toward the alcohol-related video. In summary, the repeated measurement of craving with explicit scales has a significant impact on the results of alcohol craving studies and may not always be desirable, especially when the true purpose of the study needs to be hidden from the participants. However, the present results also suggest that the pre-post experimental design is advisable when the experimenters seek to maximize the relationship between the individual levels of alcohol consumption and alcohol cue-exposure craving changes.

"854","Expectancy and attention bias to spiders: Dissecting anticipation and allocation processes using erps","The current registered report focused on the temporal dynamics of the relationship between expectancy and attention toward threat, to better understand the mechanisms underlying the prioritization of threat detection over expectancy. In the current event-related potentials experiment, a-priori expectancy was manipulated, and attention bias was measured, using a well-validated paradigm. A visual search array was presented, with one of two targets: spiders (threatening) or birds (neutral). A verbal cue stating the likelihood of encountering a target preceded the array, creating congruent and incongruent trials. Following cue presentation, preparatory processes were examined using the contingent negative variation (CNV) component. Following target presentation, two components were measured: early posterior negativity (EPN) and late positive potential (LPP), reflecting early and late stages of natural selective attention toward emotional stimuli, respectively. Behaviorally, spiders were found faster than birds, and congruency effects emerged for both targets. For the CNV, a non-significant trend of more negative amplitudes following spider cues emerged. As expected, EPN and LPP amplitudes were larger for spider targets compared to bird targets. Data-driven, exploratory, topographical analyses revealed different patterns of activation for bird cues compared to spider cues. Furthermore, 400–500 ms post-target, a congruency effect was revealed only for bird targets. Together, these results demonstrate that while expectancy for spider appearance is evident in differential neural preparation, the actual appearance of spider target overrides this expectancy effect and only in later stages of processing does the cueing effect come again into play.

"855","Effects of nicotine patches on early and late attentional bias to smoking cues: We may know less than we think","In contrast to overnight deprivation versus satiety studies, a small number of placebo-controlled studies have failed to find that nicotine administration reduces attentional bias (AB) to smoking cues. To assess the reliability of this failure and to address the duration and salience of AB in smokers versus never-smokers, we used a longer-than-typical (i.e., 3,000 ms) smoking cue-presentation time in a placebo-controlled trial of smokers and never-smokers. We aimed to assess whether a nicotine patch (i.e., active vs. placebo) attenuates continuously assessed eye gaze-measured AB to smoking cues across 3,000 ms in 32 habitual, overnight-deprived smokers and smoker–nonsmoker differences compared to 32 never-smokers. We presented a series of picture pairs (i.e., one smoking-related and one affectively neutral control picture) simultaneously to assess AB. Participants attended a 14 mg nicotine patch and a placebo patch session in a randomized order. The habitual smokers were 12–18 hr nicotine-deprived during both sessions. Smokers demonstrated a stronger AB toward smoking cues than never-smokers across the entire 3,000 ms cue-presentation time. Nicotine did not significantly reduce the AB to smoking cues but the AB was strongly and positively related to deprivation-associated cravings in smokers. Patch-delivered nicotine did not reduce AB to smoking cues presented for up to 3,000 ms, even though smoker–nonsmoker differences in bias remained. Assessments of longer cue presentations and more subtle cues may provide nuance not currently captured by existing studies, because of potential demand effects in designs that contrast overnight versus sated state effects on AB.

"856","The relationship between monetary incentives, social status, and physical activity","We conduct a field experiment to better understand the role of social status with and without monetary incentives as motivation to increase physical activity. We find that social status alone does not induce a change in physical activity. When social status is combined with monetary incentives, however, we find a change in the number of daily steps. This change is heterogeneous. Individuals with low physical activity increase their number of steps by 12%, while those with high physical activity decrease the number of steps by 25%. An incentives treatment with exogenous social status—uncorrelated with physical activity—provides robustness to our findings and, together with the control condition, rules out potential experimenter demand effects and other factors driving the results. Our results call for a cautionary approach for analyzing the role of social status, in many cases unobserved, for physical activity intervention programs.

"857","Multifactorial stress reactivity to virtual TSST-C in healthy children and adolescents—It works, but not as well as a real TSST-C","A virtual version of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) has been increasingly used in stress research. Benefits of the virtual TSST include that it is more economical, and offers improved control of context and enhanced flexibility of use. Many studies have confirmed the applicability of virtual TSSTs in stress research, but only in adulthood. In the present study, we aimed to experimentally verify the transferability of a virtual TSST to adolescence. A total of 73 healthy adolescents (aged 11–17 years) of both sexes completed either a real (IV-TSST-C) or virtual (VR-TSST-C) TSST for children. The surveyed stress parameters included salivary cortisol and alpha amylase concentrations, heart rate, heart rate variability, and subjective stress ratings across test sessions, as well as a pre- to post-TSST-C comparison. All parameters revealed significant stress responses over time. We observed significant effects of group on cortisol and subjective stress ratings, with the VR-TSST-C inducing less stress than the IV-TSST-C. In alpha amylase, heart rate, and heart rate variability, we found no significant difference between TSST versions, but only significant equivalence for alpha amylase. Some parameters may have been influenced by an expectancy effect and the participant’s sex. In conclusion, among adolescents, a virtual TSST-C effectively elicits stress at multiple levels (endocrinological, autonomic, and subjective); however, the magnitude is not always comparable to with the real TSST-C, which should be considered when applied.

"858","A Mixed-methods investigation of the implications of substance use disorder stigma for justice-involved youth","Objectives: Compared to youth without justice-involvement, justice-involved youth are more likely to experience substance use disorders. Yet, few justice-involved youth receive appropriate, evidence-based treatment for substance use disorders. Although there are numerous barriers to the accessibility of appropriate treatment, research also suggests that it is difficult to engage justice-involved youth in treatment even when it is available and accessible. It is possible that substance use disorder stigma, or negative attitudes towards youth with substance use disorders, may contribute to low treatment accessibility, and make it more difficult for justice-involved youth to engage with available treatment. Few researchers have examined substance use disorder stigma among this population. The purpose of this study was to 1) explore the nature of substance use disorder stigma among justice-involved youth, at multiple ecological levels and 2) examine the role of substance use disorder stigma in limiting the accessibility of and engagement in treatment and justice-involved youth's engagement in treatment. Methods: Participants (n = 44 youth-guardian dyads) were referred to the study by juvenile probation departments in two Indiana counties. In addition, 66 system personnel participants who work with justice-involved youth with substance use disorders were recruited from community mental health centers and juvenile probation departments in rural and suburban Indiana counties. All participants completed survey measures of substance use disorder stigma and familiarity with substance use; youth-guardian dyads also provided information about the youth's substance use history and treatment utilization. A subset of participants (n = 9 youth, 11 guardians, 12 system personnel) completed qualitative interviews, providing perspectives on substance use disorder stigma and the role of stigma in discouraging treatment. Using analysis of covariance, multiple regression analyses, and qualitative grounded theory analysis, I explored the nature of stigma toward justice-involved youth with substance use disorders and examined the impact of stigma on treatment accessibility and engagement. Results: For aim 1, as hypothesized, public stigma (assessed by survey data) varied significantly according to participant role and specific substance, with guardians endorsing greater stigma than system personnel. All participants expressed greater negative emotions towards youth with opioid use disorder compared to marijuana use disorder. Interview data revealed particularly nuanced attitudes about marijuana use. Contrary to expectations, youth reported little self-stigma. Both youth and guardians described limited knowledge of problematic substance use. For aim 2, interview data suggests that youth and guardians may identify more stigma associated with seeking treatment for problematic substance use than with using substances. All participants reported that perceived stigma has improved in recent years, and that youth feel more comfortable discussing their substance use. However, guardians identified family attitudes about behavioral health treatment as negatively impacting engagement among youth. In addition, system personnel reported that stigma continues to limit the accessibility of youth SUD treatment. Discussion: Youth endorsed lower than expected levels of self-stigma with no difference by primary substance type; this may have been affected by youth's limited understanding of problematic substance use and lower than expected heterogeneity in substance use type among participants. Consistent with prior research, self-stigma was directly related to the severity of mental health symptoms. The high prevalence of public stigma among guardians of JIY with SUDs suggests that parents and guardians would benefit from interventions to better support their caregiving experiences.

"859","Once and again: Repeated viewing affects judgments of spontaneity and preparation","Reality is fleeting, and any moment can only be experienced once. Re-watching a video, on the other hand, allows people to observe the exact same moment in time repeatedly. We propose that people apply their understanding of repetition in the real world to the replay context, failing to fully distinguish behavior that they merely observe again (through video replay) from that behavior being performed again in the exact same way. Ten experiments (N = 9,334) support this idea across a broad assortment of stimuli that includes auditions, dances, commercials, and public speeches. We demonstrate that re-watching makes a videotaped behavior appear more rehearsed and less spontaneous, as if the actor in the replayed video were simply precisely repeating the same set of actions. We rule out alternate explanations including repetition increasing accuracy of judgments, mere exposure leading to a positivity bias, and experimenter demand effects. These findings build on an influential literature showing that incidental video features like perspective or slow motion can meaningfully change how people judge the action of the video. Video re-watching may inadvertently shape judgments in contexts ranging from mundane to consequential. To understand how a video is going to influence its viewer, one will need to consider not only its content, but also how often it is viewed.

"860","When is fun ""fun""? An examination of the effects of contextual factors on appraisals of fun in the workplace","Increasing fun in the workplace is a widely touted, but little-studied, organizational intervention purported to improve a variety of employee outcomes, such as satisfaction, engagement, performance, and turnover. Some researchers have rightly noted, however, that ""fun"" activities introduced by organizations may not always be fun for employees or lead to the anticipated positive outcomes. The limited qualitative and conceptual work has identified several contextual variables surrounding fun activities that are likely to impact how these activities are appraised and experienced, and thus, whether they are associated with positive outcomes. This study utilized an experimental vignette design to investigate the effects of three such contextual variables on anticipatory appraisals of fun activities: voluntariness (i.e., whether participation is optional or required), those involved (i.e., whether other colleagues in attendance will be friends or acquaintances), and purpose of the activity (i.e., whether the activity is to benefit employees or the organization). Results from 403 participants suggest that both voluntariness and those involved have a significant impact on appraisals of events, as does participant extraversion and attitudes toward fun in the workplace. Despite limitations of vignette studies such as the potential for demand effects and lack of necessary context, the study contributes to our theoretical understanding of when fun is fun and provides clear guidance to organizations that fun is most likely to be appraised positively when events are voluntary and friends are involved, and by employees who are extraverted and believe fun in the workplace is appropriate. Future research should investigate other factors affecting appraisals and experiences of fun in the workplace and further explore the mechanisms of fun.

"861","Concordance of informant and self-reported ratings on the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale in adult survivors of pediatric brain tumor","Objective: It has been theorized that pediatric brain tumor survivors may have reduced insight into their executive functioning. Agreement between informants and survivors has been used to probe this theory, but findings have been inconsistent. This study sought to expand on prior work by examining the relationship between participant role and ratings on the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) among 73 adult survivors and their informants. This study also sought to test whether agreement on scores varied as a function of tumor treatment. Method: Dyadic mixed effects models examined the relationship between participant ratings on FrSBe subscales and the role of a participant (survivor or informant). Intraclass correlations (ICC) were used to calculate reliable change indices to evaluate significant divergence in self and informant agreement. Results: Dyadic mixed effects models showed an insignificant relationship between participant role and ratings on the FrSBe apathy and executive dysfunction subscales. Participant role was related to ratings on the disinhibition subscale of the FrSBe. The ICC for apathy was ICC = .583, for disinhibition ICC = .420, and for executive dysfunction ICC = .373. Significant divergence in scores did not vary by history of chemoradiation. Conclusions: Results demonstrate an effect of role on one FrSBe subscale and weak to moderate agreement between survivor and informant scores, which suggests that agreement between informants and survivors varies by FrSBe domain. The strongest relationship between survivors and informants was seen on apathy, which suggests that apathy is a shared concern for survivors and their families.

"862","Is gaze cuing more like endogenous or exogenous orienting?","People shift their attention in the direction of another person’s gaze. This phenomenon, called gaze cuing, shares properties with purely endogenous (i.e., “deliberate”) and purely exogenous (i.e., “reflexive”) control of spatial attention. For example, as with purely endogenous orienting, gaze cues appear at visual fixation; yet, as with purely exogenous orienting, gaze cues elicit shifts of attention rapidly after their appearance. Prior experiments have shown that when controlled endogenously versus exogenously, the effects of attention upon the processing of targets are dramatically different. Briand and Klein (1987; see also Briand, 1998) showed that endogenous orienting is additive with opportunities for illusory conjunctions, whereas exogenous orienting is interactive. Klein (1994) showed that endogenous orienting is interactive with nonspatial expectancies, whereas exogenous orienting is additive. In the present project, we applied this double-dissociation strategy to attention controlled by gaze cues. In Experiment 1, gaze cuing effects (in accuracy) were additive with opportunities for illusory conjunctions (akin to endogenous control), whereas in Experiment 2, gaze cuing was additive with the nonspatial expectancy effect (akin to exogenous orienting). Therefore, in the nature of its effects upon performance, gaze cuing functions like a hybrid of endogenous and exogenous orienting.

"863","School bullying and self-efficacy in adolescence: A meta-analysis","Introduction Given that literature has examined the relation between school bullying and self-efficacy, findings have been mixed. This meta-analysis aimed to clarify whether school bullying is associated with adolescents' self-efficacy, a key component of social information processing essential for the evaluation of potential behavioral responses. We further examined moderators associated with heterogeneity in the above relation, including participant roles, types of school bullying, types of self-efficacy, and demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, and cultural background). Method This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Statement for searching, identifying, and screening eligible articles. A total of 53 articles ( N = 71,661; M age = 12.69 years) were included (50 in English and 3 in Chinese). Articles were coded by two graduate-level coders independently with a high inter-rater reliability (97.12%). Results The results showed that (1) school bullying was negatively associated with self-efficacy ( r = -.07, p &lt; .001) among adolescents, and (2) the above relation varied by participant role (e.g., bullies, victims, bully-victims, and defenders), types of school bullying (e.g., traditional bullying, cyberbullying, and both), and types of self-efficacy (e.g., general and domain-specific self-efficacy). Findings The findings highlight that school bullying is associated with disruptive cognitive processing in adolescence, low self-efficacy in particular, and the heterogeneity should be considered to fully understand the association between school bullying and self-efficacy among adolescents.

"864","The relative frequency of true and false confessions and denials in an experimental paradigm designed to investigate deception detection","ABSTRACT Truth-default theory (TDT) proposes that deception is infrequent relative to honesty and that deception requires a motive. TDT further lists confessed deception as a viable method of improving deception detection accuracy. Findings from the experimental literature on false confessions conflict with TDT predictions suggesting that confessions might be an important boundary condition for the theory. Data from various versions of a cheating experiment (N = 485) were reexamined for the rates of true and false confessions and denials under different types of interrogation strategies including accusatory questioning and false evidence ploys.

"865","Perspective-taking and belief in a just world matter: Adolescents’ role experiences in bullying processes","Bullying is a serious problem around the world, especially among adolescents. Evidence exists that low levels of social perspective-taking as well as belief in a just world played an important role in bullying. Both dispositions function as psychological resources that may help students behave appropriately in social life. Previous research identified distinct bullying roles such as perpetrator, victim, assistant, reinforcer, defender, and bystander experiences. Although this participant-role approach has been extensively investigated in the last years, a simultaneous examination of students’ perspective-taking and belief in a just world in relation to their experiences in these roles is still missing. This study’s objective was to examine a differential approach of school students’ visuospatial and dispositional social perspective-taking, emotional concern, and personal belief in a just world in relation to their experiences in bullying roles. We tested these relations in a sample of n = 1309 adolescents (50.6% female, M age = 13.73, SD age = 0.85) from 38 schools in Germany. The results from a latent structural-equation model suggested that experiences as a perpetrator, assistant, reinforcer but also as defender related to low visuospatial social perspective-taking. Emotional concern was positively related to defender experiences. Personal belief in a just world was negatively associated with experiences as a perpetrator and a victim. The results underline the importance of disentangling concurrent contributions of perspective-taking and belief in a just world related to the bullying roles. We conclude that adolescents’ visuospatial social perspective taking seems to be a further mental resource against antisocial behavior in bullying.

"866","Resilience and depressive symptoms in inpatients with depression: A cross-lagged panel model","Background Resilience—the ability to bounce back or quickly recover from stress—has been found to predict treatment outcome in patients with mental disorders such as depression. The current study aimed to test whether resilience itself changes during treatment and whether resilience exclusively predicts changes in depressive symptoms or whether depressive symptoms also predict changes in resilience. Methods Inpatients with depression (N = 2165; average length of stay M = 60 days, SD = 32) completed the Brief Resilience Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale at admission and discharge, scores of which were used to run a cross-lagged panel model. Results Resilience increased and depressive symptoms decreased from admission to discharge. Cross-sectionally, higher resilience was related to lower depressive symptoms at admission and at discharge. Prospectively, higher resilience at admission predicted stronger decreases in depressive symptoms, and higher depressive symptoms at admission predicted smaller increases in resilience. Limitations Self-report questionnaires may potentially be biased (e.g., through recall bias, social desirability, or demand effects). Conclusions The current study further supports that resilience is related not only to fewer mental health problems cross-sectionally but also is sensitive to change and a predictor of treatment outcome in patients with mental disorders. Given this pivotal role in mental health, the current findings highlight the importance of prevention and intervention approaches for promoting resilience in the general population and in persons with mental disorders in particular.

"867","Evaluating an integrated promotion and prevention bystander approach: Early evidence of intervention benefits and moderators","Bullying victimization remains a pressing concern to the health and development of U.S. adolescents. Victims of bullying face threats to their safety and education. Hence, interventions are needed to prevent bullying and equip others to intervene in bullying situations. Prior research has examined preventive interventions with little consideration of promotion-tailored, peace-encouraging, interventions. Further, there is a need to test whether people’s motives toward preventive and promotive actions may fit with certain intervention tracks. Here, we tested an upstander approach consisting of a universal assembly presentation with promotion-oriented education (Promote Caring) and prevention-oriented education (Say Something), as well as a tailored 150-minute workshop (Upstanding for Promotion-Prevention). High school students (n = 388; 53.9% girls) participated in the study with a control group (n = 335) and intervention group who self-selected to experience upstanding for peace promotion (n = 15) or upstanding for bullying prevention (n = 35). Students in the prevention-tailored track reported stronger safety beliefs (violence prevention beliefs and care promotion beliefs) than students in the control group and endorsed using more defending actions than control-group students. Students’ gain, non-gain, and loss motivations moderated ties between upstanding track involvement and post-test safety beliefs, barriers to upstanding, and defending behaviors.

"868","Manipulating free will beliefs using online video games","Research in social psychology and experimental philosophy has investigated lay people’s free will beliefs (FWB). Using different approaches (i.e. experimental manipulations and vignette studies), they investigated how FWB relate to other concepts, and whether changing FWB has an impact on downstream processes such as social behavior. However, both approaches have shortcomings. While experimental manipulations used in social psychology suffer from demand effects, vignettes used in experimental philosophy are often highly abstract. Across two pre-registered studies, we developed a new approach by merging them in an online video game setting. Using this novel, experience-based FWB manipulation, we found that decreasing FWB impacted variables such as perceived control and responsibility in both studies. While the experience-based manipulation influenced participants’ beliefs in free will within the context of the experience (“Within the context of the scenario, would the agent believe in free will?”) in the first study, this manipulation effect did not transfer to participants’ general FWB (“Do you believe in free will?”) in the second study. Overall, our findings suggest a way forward in studying laypeople’s beliefs in free will.

Testing the moderating effects of empathy, gender, and anti-bullying norms","This study examined bidirectional associations between students' bully-directed defending behavior and their peer status (being liked or popular) and tested for the moderating role of empathy, gender, and classroom anti-bullying norms. Three waves of data were collected at 4–5-month time intervals among 3680 Finnish adolescents (M age = 13.94, 53.0% girls). Cross-lagged panel analyses showed that defending positively predicted popularity and, to a larger degree, being liked over time. No moderating effect of empathy was found. Popularity was more strongly predictive of defending, and defending was more strongly predictive of status among girls than among boys. Moreover, the positive effects of both types of status on defending were—albeit to a limited extent—stronger in classrooms with higher anti-bullying norms.

"870","The effects of cognitive bias modification on hostile interpretation bias and aggressive behavior: A systematic review and meta-analysis","BackgroundThis systematic review and meta-analysis examined the efficacy of Cognitive Bias Modification of Interpretation (CBM-I) to reduce hostile interpretation bias and aggressive behavior.MethodsWe searched PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases up until January 1, 2023, and assessed risk of bias using Cochrane’s risk of bias tool (RoB 2). We used multi-level meta-analysis to synthesize effect sizes.ResultsFourteen articles including 16 randomized studies met the inclusion criteria, yielding data from 1449 participants. CBM-I had medium effects on hostile interpretation (d = -0.62, p &lt; .001) and benign interpretation (d = 0.71, p &lt; .001), and a small effect on aggressive behavior (d = -0.28, p = .017). However, effects on interpretation bias were significant only for measures that were similar to the training method, suggesting that CBM-I effects do not generalize beyond the training task. Moreover, effects on aggressive behavior were significant only for self-reported aggression, suggesting demand effects. Effects on non-self-reported aggression were small and even zero after excluding one study with an exceptionally large effect size.ConclusionThere currently is insufficient evidence to use CBM-I as a treatment component to reduce aggressive behavior.

Participants included 1,319 Finnish individuals (59.5% identified as women; 97.4 native Finns) who were followed from adolescence into adulthood ( M age = 25.78, SD = 1.35). Victimization was indirectly associated with adult depression and aggression, through sad and angry ruminations, respectively.

"872","Profiles of participant roles in offline bullying and cyberbullying and normative beliefs among Korean adolescents","This study identified patterns of bullying roles in offline and cyber contexts among Korean adolescents and investigated their relationships with normative beliefs about offline bullying and cyberbullying. Four distinct latent classes of participant roles in offline bullying and cyberbullying emerged through a person-centered latent profile analysis: (a) low involvement (54%), (b) bully/victim-nondefenders (9.9%), (c) defenders (17%), and (d) offline bully-cyber outsiders (19.1%). Adolescents in the defenders class reported the highest levels of defending behavior both online and offline compared with adolescents in the other classes, while adolescents in the bully/victim-nondefenders class reported the highest levels in all roles except for the defending role (i.e., bully, follower, outsider, and victim roles). The overall pattern of the results was similar for the bully/victim-nondefenders and the offline bully-cyber outsiders class, though these two classes have marked differences in cyberbullying scores. The results indicated unique differences regarding antecedents (normative beliefs about offline bullying and cyberbullying) tied to patterns of roles in offline bullying and cyberbullying. The findings suggest that preventive interventions against bullying are possible by changing personal beliefs about offline bullying and cyberbullying.

"873","Directional is the new null? A comment on Bushman and Anderson (2021)","Bushman and Anderson (2021) have recently argued that the evidence of harm after playing violent video games is so strong that this effect should be our starting point for future research. They base this claim on an argument that: (a) many professional bodies agree with this opinion; (b) strong theories, such as their General Aggression Model (GAM), predict such outcomes; (c) experimental and meta-analytic studies back such a claim; and (d) people who do not obtain this effect are in the minority and their studies have methodological shortcomings or they misanalyze their data. It is argued here that this is not consistent with the precepts of falsificationism and that: (a) their argument from authority is problematic; (b) they appear unconcerned with, or unaware of, increasing null studies, particularly missing out international research or preregistered studies; (c) the majority of research groups outside of Bushman/Anderson and their coauthors do not concur with their results; and (d) there are theories (e.g., the Immersive Media Prediction model) which better account for the data than their GAM. It is also argued that when theories and data collide it is the theories that need revision not the data, demand effects of researchers are strong in gaming research, and Bushman and Anderson’s results may themselves have been influenced by their methodology rather than accurately describing a naturally occurring weakness in the human condition. It is also argued that we need a more collegial approach to gaming research and make suggestions to facilitate this shift.

"874","Defender self-efficacy and defender behaviour in school bullying of primary school pupils: The role of perceived responsibility and sex","This study examined the relationship between bullying defender self-efficacy and bullying defender behaviour in primary school pupils and the role perceived responsibility and sex played in this relationship. Participants included 1 310 pupils from Chinese primary schools attending Grades 4 to 6 (boys = 47.7%, girls = 52.3%; mean age = 10.97 years, SD = 0.98 years, age range = 8 to 14 years). Participants completed the Defender Self-Efficacy Scale, the Perceived Responsibility Scale, and the Participant Role Behaviour Scale, respectively. Following structural equation modelling, the results indicated that bullying defender self-efficacy directly predicted bullying defender behaviour in the school pupils. Perceived responsibility strengthened the association between bullying defender self-efficacy and bullying defender behaviour partly in boys, while the association between bullying defender self-efficacy and bullying defender behaviour was higher in girls rather than boys. These findings show that prosocial behaviour of primary school children from a collectivist culture is influenced by gender, so that gender is an important factor to consider when designing anti-bullying interventions for improved school citizenship.

"876","Metacognitive differentiation of item memory and source memory in schema-based source monitoring","Item memory and source memory are different aspects of episodic remembering. To investigate metamemory differences between them, the authors assessed systematic differences between predictions of item memory via Judgments of Learning (JOLs) and source memory via Judgments of Source (JOSs). Schema-based expectations affect JOLs and JOSs differently: Judgments are higher for expected source–item pairs (e.g., “nightstand in the bedroom”) than unexpected pairs (e.g., “bed in the bathroom”), but this expectancy effect is stronger on JOSs than JOLs (Schaper et al., 2019b). The current study tested theoretical underpinnings of this difference. Due to semantic priming, JOLs should be influenced by the consistency between an item and any of the schemas activated at study. JOSs, however, should be influenced by the (in)consistency between an item and its actual source. In three experiments, source–item pairs varied in strength of consistency and inconsistency. Participants provided item-wise JOLs and JOSs. Regardless of an items’ actual source, JOLs were higher the more consistent an item was with any of the source schemas, but only if that schema was activated by occurring as a source at study. JOLs were also biased by the actual source: JOLs were lower the more inconsistent an item was with its actual source. By contrast, JOSs were primarily influenced by an item’s (in)consistency with its actual source (positively for consistency, negatively for inconsistency). Thus, participants metacognitively differentiated item memory and source memory.

"877","Cautious optimism regarding the use of home-based neuromodulation to treat depression","Comments on an article by R. Morriss et al. (see record 2023-48972-015). Depression is associated with substantial global burden and disability. A large, multi-centre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial by Richard Morriss and colleagues examined the clinical effectiveness of cranial electro stimulation with the Alpha-Stim Anxiety Insomnia and Depression (AID) device, compared with sham stimulation, in people with primary major depression. This study is important, given the ongoing concerns regarding the widespread hype and marketing of cranial electrotherapy devices for neuropsychiatric conditions, despite insufficient high-quality research to support their effectiveness. The study examined the effectiveness of Alpha-Stim AID treatment that was self-administered at home for 1 h per day for 8 weeks, in patients recruited from primary care settings. A key finding of the study was that active Alpha-Stim AID treatment was not superior to sham stimulation, with both groups reporting substantial improvement in depression symptoms according to the GRID version of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HDRS-17). However, the possibility of confounding due to an expectancy effect cannot be excluded, given the novelty of the treatment. This influence could partly explain the decrease in the mean severity score for depression in both groups. Furthermore, although the authors chose to assess treatment adherence to active or sham Alpha-Stim AID at 50% of the intervention time, additional analysis examining the differences in effectiveness outcomes in the two groups with more stringent adherence criteria could have been done. The work by Morriss and colleagues offers hope regarding the safety of the Alpha-Stim AID device in treating major depressive disorder at home. However, given that the effectiveness of active treatment was not superior to sham stimulation, further evidence is required before it can be recommended as a routine treatment strategy for depressive disorders.

"879","Toward a better understanding of the causal effects of role demands on work–family conflict: A genetic modeling approach","Over the past several decades, there has been considerable interest in the theoretical causes of work–family conflict (WFC). Most studies have focused on situational determinants, often ignoring the role of personal factors such as disposition and heritable elements. We increase understanding of person versus situation influences on WFC through estimation of the relationship between role demands and WFC after controlling for genetic confounding, measured personality traits, family confounds, and other stable dispositions. Based on twin data from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS), we examine the role of genetic factors in explaining variation in WFC (both work interference with family [WIF] and family interference with work [FIW]). Results support WFC has an additive genetic component, accounting for 31% [95% CI 18%, 45%] and 16% [95% CI 2%, 30%] of the variance in WIF and FIW, respectively. In addition, we test two competing hypotheses with regard to the relationship between role demands and WFC. Results support the phenotypic causal relationship for WIF, consistent with the notion the relationship between work demands and WIF reflect situational processes. However, results support the genetic confounding hypothesis for FIW, indicating observed relationships between family demands and FIW are primarily due to genetic factors. Our results provide new insights into the nature of WFC relationships and underscore that ignoring the influence of heritability can bias estimates of role demand effects in WFC research.

"880","Vertical versus horizontal variance in online reviews and their impact on demand","This article examines the differential impact of variances in the quality and taste comments found in online customer reviews on firm sales. Using an analytic model, the authors show that although increased variance in consumer reviews about taste mismatch normally decreases subsequent demand, it can increase demand when mean ratings are low and/or quality variance is high. In contrast, increased variance in quality always decreases subsequent demand, although this effect is moderated by the amount of variance in tastes. Since these theoretical demand effects are predicated on the assumption that consumers can differentiate between the two sources of variation in ratings, the authors conduct a survey to test this assumption, demonstrating that participants are indeed able to reliably distinguish quality from taste evaluations in two subsets of 5,000 reviews taken from larger data sets of reviews for 4,305 restaurants and 3,460 hotels. The authors use these responses to construct sets of reviews that they use in a controlled laboratory experiment on restaurant choice, finding strong support for the theoretical predictions. These responses are also used to train classifiers using a bag-of-words model to predict the degree to which each review in the larger data sets relates to quality and/or taste, allowing the authors to estimate the two types of review variances. Finally, the authors estimate the effects of these variances in overall ratings on establishment sales, again finding support for the theoretical results.

These beliefs can alter study outcomes (demand effects). Neglecting demand effects can threaten the internal and external validity of studies (including their replication). While demand characteristics garnered much attention following Orne’s introduction of this notion, consideration of their effects has become sparse in experimental reports. Moreover, the concept remains confusing. Here, we introduce a conceptual framework for subjective experiences elicited by demand characteristics. The model distinguishes between participants’ awareness of the hypothesis, their motivation to comply with it, and the strategy they use to meet situational requirements. We stress that demand characteristics can give rise to genuine experiences. To illustrate, we apply the model to Evaluative Conditioning and the Rubber Hand Illusion. In the General Discussion, we discuss risks and opportunities associated with demand characteristics, and we explain that they remain highly relevant to current research.

"882","The dynamic associations between social dominance goals and bullying from middle to late childhood: The moderating role of classroom bystander behaviors","Social dominance goals have been conceptualized as orientations toward powerful and prominent positions in the peer group. Although previous studies have identified social dominance goals as one of the main motivations behind bullying, few studies have disentangled the time-invariant (average level) from the time-varying (year-to-year) effects of social dominance goals. The present study simultaneously examined the time-invariant and time-varying associations between social dominance goals and bullying, along with the moderating effects of classroom bystander behaviors (reinforcing the bully and defending the victim). A Chinese sample of third graders ( n = 615, 46.5% girls, M age = 9.29 years, SD = 0.40) and fourth graders ( n = 559, 44.9% girls, M age = 10.31 years, SD = 0.40) in four schools was surveyed three times (in May 2018, May 2019, and June 2020). Social dominance goals and bullying were self-reported. Classroom reinforcing and defending were assessed by averaging peer-reported reinforcing and defending scores for each classroom at each time point. Three-level models revealed significant time-variant and time-invariant effects of social dominance goals on bullying in classrooms with relatively low levels of defending behavior. These results suggest that both persistent and temporary social dominance goals might motivate children to engage in bullying, but peers’ defending behaviors mitigate this tendency.

"883","Assessing engagement, implementation fidelity, and costs of implementing a participatory total worker health® program","Background: In participatory intervention research, the systematic participation of frontline workers throughout the implementation of workplace changes is essential and requires careful monitoring to respond proactively to obstacles in real time. The measurement of participant engagement and implementation fidelity is inconsistent in the public health literature, and there are only a few economic evaluations of participatory workplace interventions. The commitment of personnel time and length of the participatory process are often concerns of employers, and cost estimates can help them make informed decisions about whether or not to support a participatory change process. The overall purpose of this dissertation was therefore to evaluate these features of the implementation of a participatory Total Worker Health (TWH) program called the Healthy Workplace Participatory Program (HWPP) in five public medical facilities in the New England region of the United States.Method: This dissertation describes a practical method to operationalize the longitudinal evaluation of worker engagement, implementation fidelity, and costs. Engagement was measured as the magnitude and diversity of participant effort in program implementation, with measures of effort specific to each participant role. Implementation fidelity, or the extent to which the program protocol was followed, was measured as proportion of program content implemented, dose (person-time of program exposure), and reach (representativeness of participants). Cost of personnel time entailed meeting time, time with a research coach for training on the program and meeting facilitation, and between-meeting time in program-related activities. (No other costs were incurred during the available follow-up time for this study.)Results: The five facilities achieved different stages of program completion because the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted all planned activities in March, 2020. Overall, worker Design Team (DT) members were highly engaged throughout the available follow-up time. Most DT members contributed to meeting discussions, interacted positively and respectfully, and considered equally the suggestions from supervisory and frontline workers. Four of the five facilities closely followed the program protocol during implementation and therefore had good implementation fidelity. These facilities implemented a high proportion of the program content, received more than the minimum suggested dose in the protocol guidelines, and sustained DT membership with representation of most departments and bargaining units in each facility. Those facilities following the recommended times for each step in the protocol had lower costs. In each facility, the salary costs of initiating the program represented a very small investment relative to the person-hours of program participants at work during the implementation period and to the facility's annual payroll expenses.Conclusions: Facilities established a committee structure representing multiple levels in the organization and frontline workers were highly engaged in the HWPP implementation. This dissertation illustrates the benefit of practical measures to monitor and evaluate program implementation. Consistent measurement of engagement, implementation fidelity, and costs will help compare the implementation process among studies and aggregate evidence on the impact of the implementation process on desired workforce health outcomes. Implementing participatory TWH programs ideally represents a long-term workplace investment; effectiveness evaluation of HWPP is still needed to assess its impact.

"884","The causal effects of online ratings on buyer and seller behavior","This dissertation explores how online ratings influence the actions of buyers and sellers. It begins by analyzing the causal effects of increases in star ratings on demand for products in an e-commerce market, and how those effects vary across different products, sellers, and customers. After finding significant responses from buyers to rating increases, it confirms that there is no pricing response from sellers in the same market to this demand shock. This dissertation concludes by finding that the relative pricing responses of high and low reputation sellers depends on the competition faced by the sellers.In the first chapter, I estimate the causal effect of increasing displayed product ratings by a half star on Wayfair.com using a regression discontinuity framework. This framework exploits the differences between the products' displayed ratings, which are rounded to the nearest half star when shown to customers, and the products' exact star ratings, using a dataset initially composed of 13.2 million observations for 1.0 million products. I find the effect to be a 4.1% percent increase in demand for products, which is driven by an increase in the number of sales, not a change in price, as revenue increases by a statistically equivalent amount while wholesale prices remain constant. Delving deeper, I find that products with more ratings or that are sold by lesser known brands see a large effect of star ratings on orders (up to 9.9% and 5.6%, respectively), while products with fewer ratings or that are sold by well known brands see no effect of ratings on orders. Furthermore, I find the causal effect of ratings to be heterogeneous across products with different ratings—with the highest rated products seeing the largest benefit to having a marginally higher rating (4.3%, compare to no effect for products with a rating less than 4 stars)—but not across customers with varying degrees of experience purchasing products from the site. This heterogeneity in demand effects shows that the benefits of higher ratings are not equivalent across old and new products and sellers, indicating potential policy responses by e-commerce sites.In the second chapter, I continue using the same dataset as that in Chapter 1 to confirm the hypothesis that sellers do not respond to these exogenous increases in demand for their products, due to the ease of substitution for customers and the preference for constant prices across sites the seller's product is listed. Specifically, I investigate using a regression discontinuity framework whether the wholesale prices set by sellers on Wayfair.com are causally affected by the demand shocks from ratings increases. I find that sellers on Wayfair.com do not adjust their wholesale prices in response to demand increases from ratings. This is true both overall as well as when examining subsets of products and markets along five dimensions in which I would expect stronger seller responses, if there were any. These dimensions include the degree of competition in the upstream market, the perceived–permanence of the demand shock, the product's share of seller sales, the size of the demand shock, and whether the response is in the short or long–run. Using a simple linear model of demand, I confirm that this response by sellers is rationalized by the highly elastic nature of demand in online markets.My final chapter seeks to quantify the difference in prices between products sold by high and low reputation sellers, and how that difference is related to the degree of competition they face. While past empirical work has found that high reputation sellers often charge more for their products than low reputation sellers, theory predicts this difference decreases when the competitive landscape becomes fierce.

"885","Refugee and asylum-seeking children and their families: Exploring processes of ‘integration’ within a dispersal area","The dispersal of asylum seekers to locations outside of the South East of England was an outcome of the 1999 Immigration and Asylum Act. This thesis examines the barriers and opportunities for refugee and asylum seeker children aged 6- 10 years and their families to achieve social, cultural, and economic inclusion into a North East town. The starting point of this thesis was to focus upon children, but this was expanded to include the experiences and perceptions of their parents who influence and can shape how children experience of settlement into the locality.There is a volume of research on refugees and asylum seekers 'integration' into the UK, however, these tend to be in located in multicultural spaces. This study presents an original contribution to research as it focuses upon children's and their family's experiences of 'settlement' in a socially disadvantaged and predominantly white working-class town within the North of England.This research coincided with an emerging political and policy landscape of an antiimmigration and hostile environment that was reflected in the results of the EU referendum. This research captures some of these tensions that impact upon recent patterns of forms of interactions. However, this study deconstructs the vague concept of 'integration' from the experiences of the refugees and asylum seekers in this study and offers an alternative notion of 'settlement' as a process of 'home making' and the beginning of new life in a new country.The processes of settlement are interrogated through use of the theoretical tools of Bourdieu's habitus, fields, and capitals, together with Putnam's notions of social capital and Goffman's 'presentation of self'.The fieldwork was carried out between 2015 and 2018. This included semi structured interviews with children using the medium of their own drawings to prompt discussion. Parents were also interviewed separately or alongside their children. Data was also gathered through the researcher's observer/participant role at a Refugee and Asylum Seeker Drop-In Service.A reflexive approach to research was applied so to be responsive to the ethical challenges of research with children, and their families. This was needed to negotiate the complex cultural and family practices that shaped opportunities and barriers to forms of a sense of belonging and settlement.The study found that refugee and asylum seeker families have educational values and aspirations that are reflective of other British middle-class families. This was explored in the biographical aspects of cultural capital that they brought from their country of origin. For examples interviewees adopted a long-term, strategic approach to their children's education despite their temporal status as non-UK citizens.Refugee and Asylum seeker children developed relationships exclusively with local working-class children through school settings. Whilst parents were more likely to develop friendships and contacts with middle class volunteers of mostly Christian denomination. This study found that refugee and asylum seeker adult's contact and interactions with working class adult neighbours was complex including examples of individual acts of support and care, but also examples of racially motivated symbolic and physical violence.The work concludes that despite the traumatic experiences of forced migration the refugee and asylum seeker families maintained high aspirations and optimism for their children's future in the UK. Furthermore, the study found that children are adaptable and perform and develop multiple identities to gain acceptance from their peers. The middle class orientated cultural capital and optimism of refugees and asylum seekers families should be of interest to policy makers, however, the hostile anti-immigration policy environment, both within the locality and wider society, remains a stubborn barrier to social, cultural, and economic forms of belonging and settlement.

"886","Corrigendum to “Slowed processing speed disrupts patient expectancy in late life depression” [The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry 29 (2021) 619-630]","Reports an error in ""Slowed processing speed disrupts patient expectancy in late life depression"" by Bret R. Rutherford, C. Jean Choi, Jongwoo Choi, Ben Mass, Xiaofu He, Kaleigh O'Boyle, Joel Sneed, Patrick J. Brown, Adam Brickman, Melanie M. Wall and Steven P. Roose ( The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry , 2021[Jul], Vol 29[7], 619-630). There is an omission in the published study methodology. The omitted data is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-91054-001). Objective: Slowed processing speed and executive dysfunction are associated with poor outcomes in Late Life Depression (LLD), though it is unclear why. We investigated whether these variables interfere with the development of positive treatment expectancies in an antidepressant trial. Methods: Depressed older subjects were randomized to Open (intended to increase patient expectancy) or Placebo-controlled (termed ‘Hidden,’ intended to decrease expectancy) administration of antidepressant medication for 8 weeks. Analysis of covariance analyzed the between-group difference on expectancy (Credibility and Expectancy Scale [CES]) and depression (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD], Clinical Global Impressions [CGI] Severity). Moderator analyses examined whether these Open versus Hidden differences varied based on higher versus lower processing speed and executive function. Results: Among the 108 participants, a significant between-group difference was observed on expectancy (effect size [ES, Cohen's d] = 0.51 on CES Item 2; ES = 0.64 on Item 4), indicating the manipulation was effective. Processing speed as measured by the Stroop Color-Word Test (number color-words named in congruent condition) was a significant moderator of the Open versus Hidden effect on expectancy. Depressive symptom improvement was greater on average for Open versus Hidden participants who received active drug (CGI-severity ES = 1.25, HRSD ES = 0.41), but no neurocognitive moderators of the between-group difference reached statistical significance. Conclusions: Slowed processing speed impairs the development of expectancies in antidepressant trials for LLD, which may help explain lower antidepressant response among older adults. Future studies may address whether interventions to optimize treatment expectancies are capable of improving treatment outcomes.

"887","Studies in behavioral economics","Is an option especially tempting when it is both immediate and certain? To study the effect of risk on present bias, my first chapter presents an online experiment in which workers allocate about thirty minutes of real-effort tasks between two weeks. I compare choices made two days before the first workday against choices made when work is imminent. In baseline treatments, one choice is randomly implemented; meanwhile, one treatment implements a particular allocation with certainty. By assuming that effort costs are not affected by the mechanism (and thus independent of risk preferences), my novel design permits estimation of present bias using a decision with a consequence both immediate and certain. I find the average intensity of present bias is far greater under certainty than under risk. I find no evidence that present bias is more pervasive among individuals, suggesting instead that present-biased individuals become more myopic.COVID-19 vaccination has both private and public benefits. The second chapter, co-authored with Gary Charness and David Levine, asks whether social preferences—concerns for the well-being of other people—influence one's decision regarding vaccination. We measure these social preferences for 549 online subjects: We give each subject $4 to play a public-goods game and make contributions to public welfare. To the extent that one gets vaccinated out of concern for the health of others, contribution in this game is analogous to an individual's decision to obtain COVID-19 vaccination. We collect COVID-19 vaccination history separately to avoid experimenter-demand effects. We find a strong result: Contribution in the public-goods game is associated with greater demand to voluntarily receive a first dose, and thus also to vaccinate earlier. Compared to a subject who contributes nothing, one who contributes the maximum ($4) is 48% more likely to obtain a first dose voluntarily in the four-month period that we study (April through August 2021). People who are more pro-social are indeed more likely to take a voluntary COVID-19 vaccination.Widespread vaccination is certainly a critical element in successfully fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The third chapter, co-authored with Gary Charness and David Levine, applies theories of social identity to design targeted messaging to reduce vaccine hesitancy among groups with low vaccine uptake, such as African Americans and political conservatives. We conducted an online experiment from April 7th to 27th, 2021, that oversampled Black, Latinx, conservative, and religious U.S. residents. We first solicited the vaccination status of over 10,000 individuals. Of the 4,609 individuals who reported being unvaccinated, 4,190 enrolled in our covariate-adaptive randomized trial. We provided participants messages that presented the health risks of COVID-19 to oneself and others; they also received messages about the benefits of a COVID-19 vaccine and an endorsement by a celebrity. Messages were randomly tailored to each participant's identities—Black, Latinx, conservative, religious, or being a parent. Respondents reported their intent to obtain the vaccine for oneself and, if a parent, for one's child. We report results for the 2,621 unvaccinated respondents who passed an incentivized manipulation check. We find no support for the hypothesis that customized messages or endorsers reduce vaccine hesitancy among our segments. A post hoc analysis finds evidence that a vaccine endorsement from Dr. Fauci reduces stated intent to vaccinate among conservatives. We find no evidence that tailoring public-health communication regarding COVID-19 vaccination for broad demographic groups would increase its effectiveness. We recommend further research on communicators and endorsers, as well as incentives.

"888","An examination of educator perspectives on career and college pathways for Black, indigenous, and students of color with disabilities","Black, Indigenous, and students of color (BIPOC students) in high school, who are dually experiencing the socially constructed labels of race and disability (BIPOC-SWD), are not provided with equitable access to Career and College Pathway (CCP) programs, which contributes to a lack of preparedness and success within postsecondary settings. Despite school reform policy efforts that incorporate Culturally Relevant Pedagogy (CRP), (Gay, 2002, 2010; Ladson-Billings, 1994, 2014) and Career and College Readiness frameworks (Conley 2010; Farrington et al. 2012; Monahan et al. 2020; Morningstar et al. 2017), BIPOC-SWD perpetually have lower achievement rates, poorer postsecondary outcomes, and are less prepared for careers or college (Monahan et al., 2020; Lipscomb et al., 2017; McFarland., 2017; Newman et al., 2011; Castro, 2020). Utilizing a Disability Critical Race Theory (DisCrit) (Connor et al., 2016) lens, this comparative case study was used to examine educator perceptions of the purpose and accessibility of CCPs, barriers and supports of evidence-based practices (EBPs), and traits of students who are both successful and unsuccessful in accessing or completing CCPs in a Pacific Northwest School District. A variety of educators participated in semi-structured interviews. Findings of this study include a comparison of results based on participant role and location. Significant findings included specific practices and systems contributing to gatekeeping and pushout being heavily dependent on individual educators, unclear understandings of EBPs, and heavy emphasis on educator willingness to advocate and collaborate to support diverse learners.

"889","Qualitative analysis of a kinesiology student-led sustainable exercise program targeting underserved communities","Background: The 3 WINS Fitness is a free exercise program delivered by kinesiology students to underserved communities without external funding since 2011. The program’s wins focus on reducing health inequities, increasing community health, and student professional development. The objective of this study was to conduct a qualitative evaluation of the program’s value for the participant, community, and student-instructors. Methods: We conducted 9 online focus groups (n = 51), categorized by participant role and timeline in 3 WINS: participants (4 groups), student-instructors (3 groups), and combined participants and student-instructors (2 groups). Data collection for this remote qualitative study of the 3 WINS program occurred May to June 2021. The data were analyzed to determine codes and emerging themes. Results: Three main themes are presented: asset, health, and social connection. The asset theme was subdivided into subthemes: (1) professional asset for the student-instructor, (2) program asset for the student-instructor, (3) program asset to the community, and (4) program asset for the participant. The health theme was subdivided into (1) community and (2) personal health subthemes. The social connection theme was defined in any combination, as camaraderie, friendship, connections, community, and family. Conclusion: The program improves the individual participant’s health and through role modeling for their family and friends, encourages others to follow their example thus providing a positive influence on overall community health. Concomitantly, student-instructors are developing into well-trained professionals. The 3 WINS as a student-led sustainable and replicable model can address the existing call from public health to reduce physical activity health-related diseases and inequities.

"890","Exploring the peak-end effects in air traffic controllers’ mental workload ratings","Objective: This study examined whether professional air traffic controllers (ATCos) were subject to peak-end effects in reporting their mental workload after performing an air traffic control task, and in predicting their mental workload in future scenarios. Background: In affective experience studies, people’s evaluation of a period of experience is strongly influenced by the most intense (peak) point and the endpoint. However, whether the effects exist in mental workload evaluations made by professional operators is still not known. Method: In Study 1, 20 ATCos performed air traffic control scenarios on high-fidelity radar simulators and reported their mental workload. We used a 2 (high peak, low peak) × 2 (high end, low end) within-subject design. In Study 2, another group of 43 ATCos completed a survey asking them to predict their mental workload given the same air traffic control scenarios. Results: In Study 1, ATCos reported higher mental workload after completing the high-peak and the high-end scenarios. In contrast, in Study 2, ATCos predicted the peak workload effect but not the end workload effect when asked to predict their experience in dealing with the same scenarios. Conclusion: Peak and end effects exist in subjective mental workload evaluation, but experts only had meta-cognitive awareness of the peak effect, and not the end effect. Application: Researchers and practitioners that use subjective workload estimates for work design decisions need to be aware of the potential impact of peak and end task demand effects on subjective mental workload ratings provided by expert operators.

"891","Surprising partners: Teachers' contribution to school bullying","Participant role theory describes the designation of social roles and the use of contextually appropriate social scripts and provides a context for the interpretation of a range of social and interpersonal issues, including bullying in the school setting. This study uses participant role theory to analyze interpersonal engagements in a 10th grade class in a high school in central Israel. Data were drawn from ethnographic observations conducted by the first author of the cohort over the course of a school year, together with in-depth semi-structured interviews with the students and teachers. The findings suggest that students apply “role switching” (the flexible presentation of multiple social roles, depending on context) to negotiate the challenge of bullying in the school setting. The study also assesses the influence of individual teachers on role switching, positing that a teacher's relationship with individual students can serve as a catalyst for role-switching in three specific circumstances: where the teacher–student relationship instigates bullying against a specific child; where the teacher is a bully; and where a supportive relationship enables positive role-switching on the part of specific classroom actors. These findings have theoretical and applied significance in both pre- and in-service training for teachers and school administrative staff.

"892","Does deliberation decrease belief in conspiracies?","What are the underlying cognitive mechanisms that support belief in conspiracies? Common dual-process perspectives suggest that deliberation helps people make more accurate decisions and decreases belief in conspiracy theories that have been proven wrong (therefore, bringing people closer to objective accuracy). However, evidence for this stance is i) mostly correlational and ii) existing causal evidence might be influenced by experimental demand effects and/or a lack of suitable control conditions. Furthermore, recent work has found that analytic thinking tends to increase the coherence between prior beliefs and new information, which may not always lead to accurate conclusions. In two studies (Study 1: N = 1028; Study 2: N = 1000), participants were asked to evaluate the strength of conspiracist (or non-conspiracist) explanations of events. In the first study, which used well-known conspiracy theories, deliberation had no effect. In the second study, which used relatively unknown conspiracy theories, we found that experimentally manipulating deliberation did increase belief accuracy—but only among people with a strong ‘anti-conspiracy’ or strong ‘pro-conspiracy’ mindset from the beginning, and not among those with an intermediate conspiracist mindset. Although these results generally support the idea that encouraging people to deliberate can help to counter the growth of novel conspiracy theories, they also indicate that the effect of deliberation on conspiracist beliefs is more complicated than previously thought.

"893","The inquirer, the sense maker, and the builder: Participant roles in an online working group designed to support inquiry-oriented instruction","In light of the expansion of student-centered instructional approaches in mathematics education and a brightening spotlight on instructional supports, we look to Inquiry Oriented Instruction (IOI) and explore instructors’ participation in an online working group designed to support the implementation of IOI. By coordinating the tenants IOI, the format and goals of the online working groups, and the analytic framing provided by the Instructional Triangle, three roles for the IOI professional development participants emerged: the sense maker, the inquirer, and the builder.

Here we detail two instructors’ approaches to IOI, the roles they played in in the online working group, and ultimately shed light on the intricacies of IOI and meaningful professional development engagement. Such findings support the growing bodies of research centered around IOI, corresponding professional development initiatives, and community formation in online professional development settings.

Design An A¹/B/A²/C with extended follow-up SCED with a female patient meeting diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder. Methods: Following the 6-week baseline period ‘A¹’, treatment occurred in two phases (18 ‘B’ and 6 sessions ‘C’) sandwiching a 12-week treatment withdrawal phase (‘A²’) and a 24-week structured follow-up phase. Five idiographic daily measures were collected daily to create a 622-day timeline. The PHQ-9 and the Mania Rating Scale were completed after each treatment session. The participant held two roles: as the patient and provider of the idiographic/nomothetic outcomes and also as part of the research team through providing a commentary on the outcomes identified. Results: CAT was a partially effective intervention. There were improvements to idiographic measures of self-criticism, self-acceptance, body dissatisfaction and worry. Nomothetic outcomes showed little change. CAT did not insulate from the occurrence of a hypermanic relapse during the follow-up phase. The change commentary mirrored the idiographic outcomes in noting that the ‘exits’ were harder to implement during the manic relapse. Conclusions: This co-produced SCED suggests a partially effective CAT intervention, but with exits much harder to sustain during manic relapse. Methodologically, it is possible to improve SCED methodology through widening the participant role further beyond that of data collection.

Positive inter-ethnic contact norms in class were positively associated with intention to comfort the victim. Teachers' non-tolerance of ethnic victimization was positively related to adolescents' intentions to ask the perpetrator to stop and talk to teacher. The effects were the same across adolescents with different attitudes toward immigrants. Findings highlight the importance of class context and teachers in fostering adolescents' prosocial and assertive interventions in bias-based hostile behaviors.

"896","Children with developmental dyslexia show an increased variable foreperiod effect","Dyslexia has been linked to timing deficits by previous studies. Here, we investigated specifically two types of implicit temporal adaptation abilities in children with dyslexia, namely the variable foreperiod effect and time-based expectancy. Eighteen children with dyslexia and eighteen typically developing children with ages ranging from 8 to 13 participated. They completed a binary choice reaction time task in which short (1,000 ms) or long (3,000 ms) durations of a visual cue (i.e. foreperiod) predicted with a probability of .9 the direction of a centrally presented arrow. Dyslexic children showed a significantly more pronounced variable foreperiod effect (i.e. responding faster to long foreperiods than to short foreperiods) than normally developing children. However, there were no significant differences between groups in the time-based expectancy effect (i.e. responding differently to likely combinations of foreperiod and target than to unlikely combinations). The results are discussed in the context of time-deficit theories of dyslexia.

"897","Delaying metamemory judgments corrects the expectancy illusion in source monitoring: The role of fluency and belief","In schema-based source monitoring, people mistakenly predict better source memory for expected sources (e.g., oven in the kitchen; expectancy effect ), whereas actual source memory is better for unexpected sources (e.g., hairdryer in the kitchen; inconsistency effect ; Schaper et al., 2019b). In three source-monitoring experiments, the authors tested whether a delay between study and metamemory judgments remedied this metamemory expectancy illusion. Further, the authors tested whether delayed judgments were based on in-the-moment experiences of retrieval fluency or updating of belief due to experiences with one’s source memory. Participants studied source–item pairs and provided metamemory judgments either at study or after delay. After delay, they made judgments either on the complete source–item pair (eliciting no source retrieval, Experiment 1) or on the item only (eliciting covert, Experiment 1, or overt source retrieval, Experiments 2 and 3). Metamemory judgments at study showed the established illusory expectancy effect, as did delayed judgments when no source retrieval was elicited. However, when participants retrieved the source prior to delayed judgments, they predicted an inconsistency effect on source memory, which concurred with actual memory. Thus, delaying judgments remedied the metamemory expectancy illusion.

"898","Effects of the KiVa anti-bullying program on affective and cognitive empathy in children and adolescents","Objective: As empathy is an important predictor of both bullying and defending behavior, many anti-bullying interventions aim to increase empathy among students. However, little is known on whether these interventions enhance both affective and cognitive empathy, and whether some students are more responsive than others to empathy-raising efforts. This study examined the effects of the Finnish anti-bullying program KiVa on changes in self-reported affective and cognitive empathy and tested whether these effects varied depending on students’ gender, initial levels of empathy, peer-reported bullying, and peer-perceived popularity, as well as school type (primary versus secondary school) and classroom bullying norms. Method: Multilevel structural equation modeling analyses were conducted on pretest and posttest (1 year later) data from a sample of 15,403 children and adolescents ( M age = 13.4; 51.5% girls) in 399 control and 462 intervention classrooms from 140 schools participating in the evaluation of KiVa in 2007–2009. Results: KiVa had a positive effect on affective empathy, but not cognitive empathy. The effects of the program on both types of empathy did not depend on students’ gender, initial levels of empathy, bullying, or popularity, nor on school type or classroom bullying norms. Conclusion: Findings suggest that KiVa can raise students’ affective empathy regardless of students’ gender, status, initial empathy, or levels of bullying, and regardless of school type or classroom bullying norms.

"899","Heritability of bullying and victimization in children and adolescents: Moderation by the KiVa antibullying program","Objective: Bullying affects approximately a quarter of schoolchildren and is associated with numerous adverse outcomes. Although distinct risk factors for bullying and victimization have been identified, few studies have investigated the genetic and environmental underpinnings of bullying and victimization. The aims of this study were twofold: first, to examine the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to bullying and victimization, and second, to analyze whether the KiVa antibullying program moderated the magnitude of these contributions by comparing estimates derived from the KiVa versus control groups. Method: The sample comprised students from schools that participated in the evaluation of the KiVa antibullying program in Finland during 2007–2009. Bullying and victimization were measured using peer nominations by classmates. The sample for the twin analyses comprised of 447 twins (107 monozygotic and 340 dizygotic twins) aged 7–15. Results: Genetic contributions accounted for 62% and 77% of the variance in bullying and in victimization at pre-intervention, respectively. There was a post-intervention difference in the overall role of genetic and environmental contributions between the intervention and the control group for bullying and victimization, with non-shared environmental effects playing a lesser role (and genes a larger role) in the intervention than in the control group context. Conclusions: This study replicates previous findings on the genetic underpinnings of both bullying and victimization, and indicates that a school-based antibullying program reduces the role of non-shared environmental factors in bullying and victimization. The results indicate that prevention and intervention efforts need to target both environmental and (heritable) individual level factors to maximize effectiveness.

"900","Adolescent bystanders’ moral emotions in cyberbullying","The purpose of the current study was to extensively investigate not only bystander roles but also individual bystanders’ moral emotional responses in the context of cyberbullying based on the perpetrator's perceived popularity and the message type. Data from 566 adolescents in grade 7 attending six middle schools in South Korea were used to identify their bystander behavior and moral emotions in response to vignettes about cyber scenarios. Using latent profile analysis, the current study identified five types of bystanders: limited bystanders, pro-bullies, outsiders, defenders, and inconsistent bystanders. Moreover, multinomial logistic regressions were performed to determine the predictive power of the moral emotions of each bystander type. The findings indicated the importance of understanding bystanders’ roles for designing effective intervention strategies regarding moral emotions, leading to adolescents’ improved moral sensitivity.

"901","Cortico-brainstem mechanisms of biased perceptual decision-making in the context of pain","Prior expectations can bias how we perceive pain. Using a drift diffusion model, we recently showed that this influence is primarily based on changes in perceptual decision-making (indexed as shift in starting point). Only during unexpected application of high-intensity noxious stimuli, altered information processing (indexed as increase in drift rate) explained the expectancy effect on pain processing. Here, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural basis of both these processes in healthy volunteers. On each trial, visual cues induced the expectation of high- or low-intensity noxious stimulation or signaled equal probability for both intensities. Participants categorized a subsequently applied electrical stimulus as either low- or high-intensity pain. A shift in starting point towards high pain correlated negatively with right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity during cue presentation underscoring its proposed role of “keeping pain out of mind”. This anticipatory right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex signal increase was positively correlated with periaqueductal gray (PAG) activity when the expected high-intensity stimulation was applied. A drift rate increase during unexpected high-intensity pain was reflected in amygdala engagement and increased functional connectivity between amygdala and PAG. Our findings suggest involvement of the PAG in both decision-making bias and altered information processing to implement expectancy effects on pain.

"904","Automatic classification of participant roles in cyberbullying: Can we detect victims, bullies, and bystanders in social media text?","Successful prevention of cyberbullying depends on the adequate detection of harmful messages. Given the impossibility of human moderation on the Social Web, intelligent systems are required to identify clues of cyberbullying automatically. Much work on cyberbullying detection focuses on detecting abusive language without analyzing the severity of the event nor the participants involved. Automatic analysis of participant roles in cyberbullying traces enables targeted bullying prevention strategies. In this paper, we aim to automatically detect different participant roles involved in textual cyberbullying traces, including bullies, victims, and bystanders. We describe the construction of two cyberbullying corpora (a Dutch and English corpus) that were both manually annotated with bullying types and participant roles and we perform a series of multiclass classification experiments to determine the feasibility of text-based cyberbullying participant role detection. The representative datasets present a data imbalance problem for which we investigate feature filtering and data resampling as skew mitigation techniques. We investigate the performance of feature-engineered single and ensemble classifier setups as well as transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs). Cross-validation experiments revealed promising results for the detection of cyberbullying roles using PLM fine-tuning techniques, with the best classifier for English (RoBERTa) yielding a macro-averaged F 1-score of 55.84%, and the best one for Dutch (RobBERT) yielding an F 1-score of 56.73%.

"905","Do letters about conspiracy belief studies greatly exaggerate? A reply to Sutton and Douglas","Reply by the current author to the comments made by Robbie M. Sutton and Karen M. Douglas (see record 2022-49320-007) on the original article (see record 2020-39454-001). In the design of our study about coronavirus conspiracy beliefs and the consequences for adherence to social distancing guidelines, we thought very carefully about the content of questionnaire items, and their associated scales, in order to test the primary hypothesis. We chose to develop item content that was unambiguous, extreme, and false. We selected a response scale to assess any degree of endorsement in a manner easily understandable for participants and simple to interpret. Respondents were presented with stark beliefs and a clear decision to make about endorsement. Hence, we could test whether any countenance of the extreme beliefs - which might include a degree of acquiescence, though there was no ambiguity in the statements being endorsed - affects adherence to social distancing guidelines. It is a study about how belief may drive action and any belief in an obvious conspiracy theory might be socially damaging. It should not be forgotten that there was a very simple, low cognitive load option for responding to the extreme beliefs: ‘do not agree’. There is also evidence that online surveys can be resistant to demand effects. The measurement method for conspiracy beliefs was grounded in clinical studies assessing delusions, in which a single dimension is isolated of degree of conviction in unfounded beliefs [from do not believe (0%) to completely believe (100%)]. Deliberately avoided is a single ‘completely disbelieve’ (-100%) to ‘completely believe’ (100%) scale. This avoidance is partly because of difficulties in interpreting such dimensions of disagreement and partly because of empirical evidence that shows that the degree to which an individual believes a delusional belief is separate (to an extent) from the degree to which he or she thinks that they could be mistaken.

The goals of this study were to review the rationale for screening for ACEs and examine impacts of screening on access to referrals and services for identified needs. This is an important clinical question because new efforts to mandate ACEs screening are being adopted in states such as California. Cautions about such implementation have been raised, even by one of the original ACE study authors. Critics have warned that population level ACE questionnaires being used are not validated screening instruments and that they do not have predictive value at the individual level and can induce an expectancy effect, in which identified problems may lead to unnecessarily proactive identification of future toxic stress and resultant problem.

"908","Is second best good enough? An EEG study on the effects of word expectancy in sentence comprehension","Sentence comprehension can be facilitated when readers anticipate the upcoming word. Notwithstanding, it remains uncertain if only the most expected word is anticipated, as postulated by the serial graded hypothesis, or if all probable words are pre-activated, as proposed by the parallel probabilistic hypothesis. To test these contrasting accounts, we compared the processing of expected and unexpected words with second-best words, i.e. the second most expected word in a sentence. The results, from 30 participants, revealed a graded facilitation effect for the expected words, indexed by the N400 mean amplitude, which was the least negative for the most expected words, intermediate for second-best words, and most negative for unexpected words. The Post-N400 Positivity analysis did not reveal any significant effects. The facilitation effect found for the most expected and second-best words suggests that readers can pre-activate multiple candidates during sentence comprehension.

Police officer applicants completed the CPI-434 under high and then again under low demand conditions. The high demand condition was represented by the CPI administration as part of the preemployment psychological evaluation. The low demand condition was represented by a CPI administration with no contingencies approximately 4 months later during the police academy. Demand effects were illustrated by comparing applicant scores (within-subject) under high versus low demand conditions on CPI-Police and Public Safety Report (CPI-PPSR) prediction equations and CPI scales. Significant demand effects were observed on 23 of 46 comparisons.

"910","Examining barriers and strategies for effective professional or interagency collaboration in secondary transition","Background: For young adults with disabilities, post-high school outcomes in employment, higher education, and independent living are markedly worse than for peers without disabilities. As a result, legislation and research aimed at supporting transitioning students with disabilities has increased. Further, numerous initiatives that better support youth and families have been implemented at the state and local level. Collaboration within and across service delivery systems has been identified as a critical aspect of transition planning and supports; however, evidence-based research related to the implementation and effects of collaborative partnerships is limited. Objective: In the current study, we identify transition professionals’ perceptions of collaborative factors that facilitate and inhibit collaboration. Method: This study utilizes a single-state survey research design to examine the viewpoints of people in transition professions, specifically educators, Vocational Rehabilitation professionals, and community supports providers. Results: Variances in perceptions were found among participant role groups. Specifically, educators as a whole report that time and workload barriers affect their ability to collaborate effectively. Further, findings indicate that ensuring individual collaborative team member responsibility is perceived as an effective strategy. Conclusions: These findings may be applied to technical assistance providers when developing team-level evaluations to monitor current levels and support needs of collaborative transition planning teams.

"911","Mechanisms of meditation: Investigating the components and covariates of a single session of meditation","Meditation research has expanded exponentially over the past few decades, establishing consistent effects of improved well-being; however, little work has focused on experimentally investigating the underlying mechanisms of how meditation improves well-being. Additionally, there is a consensus in the field to address sources of bias and the role of placebo and demand effects by implementing more rigorous methods. Therefore, with these motivations in mind, the goal of this dissertation is to provide confirmatory and exploratory evidence on the effects of meditation in a series of single-session, randomized controlled trials. Chapter 1 establishes the base effect by comparing the effects of a mindful Meditation to an informational Control, which were both labeled as a ""relaxation exercise"" to participants, on several measures of well-being. Then, this effect is re-examined by taking into account the mechanistic role of two aspects of a person's internal state: expectations, or how much a person expects to improve from a session of meditation, and thought valence, or how positive or negative a person's thoughts were during the meditation. Chapter 2 aims to replicate and expand upon these results by comparing Meditation and Control to isolated components of meditation: Breath (slow breathing), Mind (meta-awareness), and Detachment (meta-awareness and detachment). Again, the mechanistic role of internal experiences is assessed. After elucidating key components and potential mechanisms of meditation, Chapters 3 and 4 aimed to explore potential sources of bias or inflated results. Using only the Meditation Intervention, Chapter 3 investigates the causal role of expectations by manipulating participant knowledge of the intervention in two ways: presence/absence of the Label ""meditation"", and presence/absence of a Placebo statement. Finally, Chapter 4 addresses exploratory questions on meditation efficacy and equity. Conclusively, this study (1) quantifies observable changes in well-being due to a single session of meditation, while considering the mechanistic role of internal experiences; (2) clarifies which components of meditation are necessary or sufficient to improved well-being within a single session, again looking at the role of internal experience; (3) determines how much a label and demand effects contribute to a potential placebo effect within meditation interventions; and (4) evaluates the efficacy and equity of meditation as a treatment with exploratory analyses.

"912","Cyber-bystanders’ reactions toward tourism companies’ prejudice practice during the COVID-19 pandemic","Prejudice against tourists from the epidemic areas or those infected during the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted much attention. While many studies examined the influence of this prejudice on tourists themselves, little research has been conducted to identify cyber-bystanders’ reactions to tourism companies' prejudice practice. This study aims to fill this gap by revealing the process of how cyber-bystanders identify, evaluate, and respond online to prejudice practice in the context of the tourism industry. The study developed a conceptual model to examine the influential factors and their internal relationship of cyber-bystanders’ reactions. A multistage model was proposed based on the social comparison theory. An online survey was conducted in mainland China, and 558 useable questionnaires were collected. The three-process model was estimated using the Bootstrap mediation test and hierarchical regression analysis. The results indicate that cyber-bystanders’ prejudice recognizing process could impact their reactions through the influence of their evaluation behaviors. Meanwhile, the collective sentiment on social media has a moderating effect on the relationship between cyber-bystanders’ evaluating process and their reactions to prejudice practice. Both theoretical and practical implications were discussed.

"913","The benefits of teaching on comprehension, motivation, and perceived difficulty: Empirical evidence of teaching expectancy and the interactivity of teaching","Background: Research regarding teaching expectancy has been mostly conducted in research laboratories with college students. These studies provide insufficient evidence regarding its effect on learners’ delayed comprehension. Moreover, the relative superiority of teaching a peer face to face compared to teaching an imagined peer lacks empirical support. Aims: The purpose of the study was to investigate the interactivity of teaching by comparing peer teaching to imagined teaching, as well as enhancing the generalizability of the teaching expectancy effect by testing it in a secondary school environment. Sample: A total of 597 students (282 males) from 12 classes in a secondary school were recruited to participate in the study as part of their psychology course. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to one of six conditions formed by a 2 (teaching expectancy vs. testing expectancy) × 3 (peer teaching vs. imagined teaching vs. no teaching) between-subjects design. Their immediate and delayed comprehension tests, motivation, and perceived difficulty were measured as dependent variables. Results: Imagined teaching enhanced both immediate and delayed comprehension, but peer teaching only enhanced immediate comprehension. Moreover, the effects of imagined teaching on perceived difficulty and motivation were dependent upon teaching expectancy or testing expectancy. Conclusions: Our findings provide empirical evidence to the existing theoretical frameworks, but caution should be taken when applying imagined teaching in practice.

In this article we apply a recent experimental medicine (EM) framework to this body of research. Method: A conceptual review and focused discussion of the relevant literature is presented. Results: We illustrate how it is possible to translate findings from studies of food and alcohol intake in the laboratory into interventions that are effective for changing behavior in the real world. We go on to demonstrate how systematic failures can occur at different stages within the EM framework, and how these failures ultimately result in interventions that are ineffective for changing behavior. We also consider methodological issues that may constrain the external validity of findings from laboratory studies including demand effects, participant characteristics, and the timing and dose of behavioral interventions. Throughout, we make recommendations to improve the translation of findings from laboratory studies into behavior change interventions that are effective in the field. Conclusions: Consideration of the EM framework will help to ensure that promising candidate interventions for eating and drinking that are identified in laboratory studies can fulfill their translational promise.

"915","Prior prognostic expectations as a potential predictor in neurofeedback training","The present study evaluated whether subjects’ expectations and neurofeedback training performance predict neurofeedback efficacy in cognitive training by controlling both factors as statistical variables. Twenty-two psychology students underwent neurofeedback training, employing beta/theta protocol to enhance beta1 power (13–21 Hz) and suppress theta (4–7 Hz) power. Neurofeedback efficacy was evaluated by behavioral components measured on pre-tests and post-tests employing a visual continuous performance task. The results revealed a significant interaction term between change in reaction time from pre-test to post-test and expectancy effect, indicating that participants with high prognostic expectations showed better improvement in reaction time scores. The data did not reveal that actual neurofeedback performance influenced the post-test measurements of the visual continuous performance task. No significant differences were found for reaction time variability, omission, or commission errors. Possible factors contributing to the results are discussed, and directions for future research are suggested.

The objective of this qualitative assessment was to better understand what individual and facility level factors may have contributed to the impact of COVID- 19 on Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) and Environmental Services (EVS) staff working in nursing homes. Methods: Based on a simple random sample from the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), 7,520 facilities were emailed invitations requesting one CNA and/or one EVS staff member for participation in a voluntary focus group over Zoom. Facility characteristics were obtained via NHSN and publicly available sources; participant demographics were collected via Survey Monkey during registration and polling during focus groups. Qualitative information was coded using NVIVO and Excel. Results: Throughout April 2021, 23 focus groups including 110 participants from 84 facilities were conducted homogenous by participant role. Staffing problems were a recurring theme reported. Participants often cited the toll the pandemic took on their emotional well-being, describing increased stress, responsibilities, and time needed to complete their jobs. The lack of consistent and systematic guidance resulting in frequently changing infection prevention protocols was also reported across focus groups. Conclusions: Addressing concerns of low wages and lack of financial incentives may have the potential to attract and retain employees to help alleviate nursing home staff shortages. Additionally, access to mental health resources could help nursing home staff cope with the emotional burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. These frontline staff members provided invaluable insight and should be included in improvement efforts to support nursing homes recovering from the impact of COVID-19 as well as future pandemic planning.

"917","Reciprocal links between teacher-student relationships and peer victimization: A three-wave longitudinal study in early adolescence","Although teachers play a central role in tackling peer victimization at school, no study so far has investigated transactional associations between positive and negative teacher-student relationship dimensions and peer victimization in early adolescence. Investigating both dimensions simultaneously in upper elementary school allows to examine differential effects on peer victimization (and vice versa) and could aid tailored prevention and intervention efforts. At three time points within one school year, self-reported teacher-student closeness and conflict and self- and peer-reported peer victimization were assessed in a sample of 930 fourth to sixth grade students ( M age = 10.55 years, 53.1% girls). Cross-lagged models revealed negative within-time associations between closeness and self-reported peer victimization, and positive within-time associations between conflict and self-reported peer victimization at most time points. Whereas closeness and conflict negatively predicted each other across the school year, no bidirectional longitudinal effects were found between teacher-student relationships and peer victimization. The current findings highlight the need for early prevention and intervention efforts to tackle peer victimization, build positive teacher-student relationships, and especially reduce negative teacher-student relationships.

"918","Effect of antenatal education on childbirth self-efficacy: A systematic-review and meta-analysis","Childbirth self-efficacy is useful measure for maternal well-being and a wide variety of improved perinatal outcomes. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aims to examine the effectiveness of antenatal education on childbirth self-efficacy level of pregnant women. The systematic searches were conducted in nine databases in July 2019. The PRISMA checklist was used. The quality of studies was evaluated by two researchers. The random-effect model was used in the present meta-analysis. The heterogeneity tests, moderator and sensitivity analyses were performed. There were eligible seven articles. Antenatal education had a large, positive effect on outcome expectancy (Effect size = 3.817, 95% CI 1.71 to 5.93, p = .000) and efficacy expectancy (Effect size = 3.520, 95% CI 1.67 to 5.37, p = .000). Substantial evidence suggested high heterogeneity. Antenatal education is effective in promoting women’s belief in themselves about not only ability of coping with birth, but also desired outcome of coping behavior which is effective in achieving a positive birth experience. Health professionals should provide antenatal education to promote women’s belief about their behavior during the birth process. There are need further studies by considering suggestions of the present study.

"919","Frenemy: A new addition to the bullying circle","Greater knowledge on the social complexities of bullying is crucial to reduce actual bullying behavior. Two main approaches have been used to study bullying: the participant role approach and the bullying circle. In this study, we explored bullying through interviewing adults who had been victims of school bullying in the past, investigating how they perceived their experiences, and how they interpreted the bullying context and their surrounding peer relations. We interviewed 20 participants (more than 18 years old), all of whom had experience of being bullied for more than 1 year. The interview data were then analyzed with a thematic analysis. We found that participants had a different definition of bullying compared with the standard definition formulated by researchers. They also confirmed the fluidity of participants’ roles and the changes in behavioral patterns toward victims, depending on the peer context. Most importantly, we revealed a new participant in the bullying circle: the frenemy, whose intervention style changes from pro-victim when alone with the victim to neutral or pro-aggressor when surrounded by members of the bullying circle. This new addition adds to our understanding of the bullying process and the relationships within the bullying circle, which may help with more effective prevention.

"920","The costs (and benefits) of effortful listening on context processing: A simultaneous electrophysiology, pupillometry, and behavioral study","There is an apparent disparity between the fields of cognitive audiology and cognitive electrophysiology as to how linguistic context is used when listening to perceptually challenging speech. To gain a clearer picture of how listening effort impacts context use, we conducted a pre-registered study to simultaneously examine electrophysiological, pupillometric, and behavioral responses when listening to sentences varying in contextual constraint and acoustic challenge in the same sample. Participants ( N = 44) listened to sentences that were highly constraining and completed with expected or unexpected sentence-final words (“The prisoners were planning their escape/party”) or were low-constraint sentences with unexpected sentence-final words (“All day she thought about the party ”). Sentences were presented either in quiet or with +3 dB SNR background noise. Pupillometry and EEG were simultaneously recorded and subsequent sentence recognition and word recall were measured. While the N400 expectancy effect was diminished by noise, suggesting impaired real-time context use, we simultaneously observed a beneficial effect of constraint on subsequent recognition memory for degraded speech. Importantly, analyses of trial-to-trial coupling between pupil dilation and N400 amplitude showed that when participants’ showed increased listening effort (i.e., greater pupil dilation), there was a subsequent recovery of the N400 effect, but at the same time, higher effort was related to poorer subsequent sentence recognition and word recall. Collectively, these findings suggest divergent effects of acoustic challenge and listening effort on context use: while noise impairs the rapid use of context to facilitate lexical semantic processing in general, this negative effect is attenuated when listeners show increased effort in response to noise. However, this effort-induced reliance on context for online word processing comes at the cost of poorer subsequent memory.

"921","Examining the potential mental health costs of defending victims of bullying: A longitudinal analysis","It has been speculated that defending victims of bullying is stressful for youth, and may contribute to poor mental health among those who regularly intervene to defend their victimized peers. However, the extant literature is thus far primarily limited to correlational, single-informant studies. The current study examined the concurrent and prospective mental health costs (e.g., social anxiety, depressive symptoms) of peer-reported defending among 4085 youth (43.9% boys; M age = 14.56, SD = 0.75). Moreover, we examined two potential moderators (victimization and popularity) of the association between defending and internalizing problems. Analyses revealed that there was no evidence of a direct, positive relationship between defending and internalizing symptoms. However, a positive, concurrent association was found between defending and social anxiety, but only among youth who reported that they were also victims – the association was negative among non-victimized youth. In addition, both peer-reported victimization and social status were found to moderate the longitudinal relationship between defending and later symptoms of depression. Specifically, among low-status highly victimized youth, defending was associated with an increased risk of experiencing symptoms of depression, whereas high-status youth who were rarely seen as victims reported decreased symptoms of depression at T2 if they also had a reputation for defending others. The findings suggest that defending others is likely not a risk factor for youth who are not already vulnerable and/or have the protection of high status, and may actually have a protective effect for these youth.

The present study evaluated the psychometric properties of the BPBQ in a Chinese middle school sample. A total of 516 middle school students (47.7% girls; age range = 12–14 years) were recruited from an urban middle school in China. Results revealed that a five-factor model fit the data best. Correlations between the BPBQ subscale scores and the external criterion variables, including empathy and sympathy, moral disengagement, and trait anger, provided evidence of criterion validity. Furthermore, the BPBQ had good alpha reliability and moderate to good test-retest reliability. In conclusion, the BPBQ is a promising assessment tool to measure bullying participant behaviors among Chinese middle school students.

We examined whether and how family functioning and moral disengagement affect four types of bystander behavior in school bullying. Data were collected from 1,035 early adolescents at two junior high schools in China, who completed scales measuring family functioning, moral disengagement, and bystander behavior. Results show that healthier family functioning was associated with a higher level of bystander defending behavior and a lower level of bystander assisting, reinforcing, and outsider behavior. These associations were partly mediated by adolescents’ moral disengagement. Our findings have important implications for the understanding and reduction of school bullying.

"924","The problem of demand effects in power studies: Moving beyond power priming","Power in experimental research has been commonly induced by methods that raise concerns regarding demand effects. In this paper, we investigate the empirical relevance of these concerns. In an incentivized online study ( N = 1632), we manipulated the method of power manipulation (power priming vs. resource allocation), the level of power (high-power vs. control), and the presence of a manipulation check after the power manipulation. We then assessed risk-taking as an outcome variable in two ways, once as a non-consequential measure (self-report measure) and twice as a consequential measure (incentivized behavioral choices). Our results show that both using power priming (vs. resource allocation) and implementing a manipulation check substantially increased the potential for demand effects as measured by the proportion of participants who were aware of the study hypothesis. In addition, we were able to replicate the positive effect of power on risk-taking previously reported in the literature. However, we only found a significant (and small) effect for our non-consequential measure of risk-taking; when risk-taking was measured with either of our two consequential measures, power had no significant impact. Our pattern of results shows that concerns about demand effects in priming studies cannot be dismissed. We advise researchers, especially those studying power, to steer away from demand-prone manipulations of power and to measure outcome variables (e.g., behavior) through consequential choices.

"925","To help or not to help: Intervening in cyberbullying among Chinese cyber-bystanders","Cyberbullying has become a serious concern among Internet users worldwide. However, relatively little is known about individuals who witness cyberbullying and how they behave. A bystander is someone who sees bullying or other forms of aggressive or violent behavior that targets someone else and who may choose to respond by either being part of the problem (a hurtful bystander), or part of the solution (a helpful bystander). Few studies examined the phenomena of cyber-bystanders in Chinese populations. Guided by the five-step bystander theoretical model and the theory of planned behavior, this study, addressed this gap to understand how the characteristics of cyber-bystanders explained their intervention in cyberbullying in a Chinese population. This study tested two preregistered hypotheses: (1) controlling for age and gender, awareness of cyberbullying, attitudes, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control to intervene; plus past experience with cyberbullying (measured as past experience in cyberbullying perpetration and victimization), felt responsibility, and self-efficacy to intervene with regard to cyberbullying would explain the intention of cyber-bystanders to intervene in cyberbullying, and (2) the intention of cyber-bystanders to intervene cyberbullying would positively explain their intervening behavior. A total of 581 college students with experience of witnessing cyberbullying were included in the analysis. Applying structural equation modeling with observed variables, a path analysis model was built to test the hypotheses; this study also conducted exploratory analyses by including direct paths from the characteristics of cyber-bystanders to explain intervening behavior. Results found that only awareness of cyberbullying, a subjective norm, and self-efficacy to intervene positively explained intention to intervene cyberbullying; therefore, hypothesis 1 was partly supported. Also, intention to intervene cyberbullying positively explained intervening behavior; therefore, hypothesis 2 was supported. For the exploratory analysis, intention to intervene partially mediated the relation between a subjective norm to intervene and intervening behavior; and intention to intervene also partially mediated the relation between self-efficacy to intervene and intervening behavior. In addition, past experience in cyberbullying victimization also positively and directly predicted intervening behavior. Findings provided a foundation for designing future intervention programs to mobilize cyber-bystanders to become “upstanders.” (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)","","","","","","Leung, Angel Nga Man","2021","https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/help-not-intervening-cyberbullying-among-chinese/docview/2827724275/se-2?accountid=14026","APA PsycInfo (2024)"
"926","Navigating the last mile: The demand effects of click-and-collect order fulfillment","Many retailers are rushing into the click-and-collect (C&amp;C) format, where shoppers place orders online and pick up the goods themselves later. The authors study the demand implications of C&amp;C and postulate how different ways of organizing this format—each with its own convenience features—appeal to households with different shopper characteristics. Using two data sets, each covering the introduction of two C&amp;C fulfillment types by a major grocery retailer in a large number of local markets, the authors compare the impact of in-store fulfillment (pickup at existing stores), near-store fulfillment (pickup at outlets adjoining stores), and stand-alone fulfillment (pickup at free-standing locations). The authors find that the shift in online consumer spending significantly differs between the three order fulfillment types, as does the impact on total spending. No one order fulfillment type systematically dominates; the effects depend heavily on shopper characteristics. The study’s results provide guidance on which C&amp;C fulfillment type(s) to operate under what conditions and caution retailers not to take the easy in-store route routinely.

There is an omission in the published study methodology. The omitted data is present in the erratum.] Objective: Slowed processing speed and executive dysfunction are associated with poor outcomes in Late Life Depression (LLD), though it is unclear why. We investigated whether these variables interfere with the development of positive treatment expectancies in an antidepressant trial. Methods: Depressed older subjects were randomized to Open (intended to increase patient expectancy) or Placebo-controlled (termed ‘Hidden,’ intended to decrease expectancy) administration of antidepressant medication for 8 weeks. Analysis of covariance analyzed the between-group difference on expectancy (Credibility and Expectancy Scale [CES]) and depression (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD], Clinical Global Impressions [CGI] Severity). Moderator analyses examined whether these Open versus Hidden differences varied based on higher versus lower processing speed and executive function. Results: Among the 108 participants, a significant between-group difference was observed on expectancy (effect size [ES, Cohen's d] = 0.51 on CES Item 2; ES = 0.64 on Item 4), indicating the manipulation was effective. Processing speed as measured by the Stroop Color-Word Test (number color-words named in congruent condition) was a significant moderator of the Open versus Hidden effect on expectancy. Depressive symptom improvement was greater on average for Open versus Hidden participants who received active drug (CGI-severity ES = 1.25, HRSD ES = 0.41), but no neurocognitive moderators of the between-group difference reached statistical significance. Conclusions: Slowed processing speed impairs the development of expectancies in antidepressant trials for LLD, which may help explain lower antidepressant response among older adults. Future studies may address whether interventions to optimize treatment expectancies are capable of improving treatment outcomes.

"928","Mindfulness and smoking frequency: An investigation with Australian students","Mindfulness training has been shown to be effective in reducing smoking frequency. However, mindfulness training instructions that are free of mentions about smoking are rare, which makes it difficult to ascertain if it is the temporary state of being mindful or demand effects that reduce smoking frequency. It has also been posited that mindfulness training lowers smoking frequency by helping smokers surf the urge, but this remains untested. Thus, we conducted an experiment to test the likely process. We used a 6-minute audio clip to induce a brief mindfulness state or a mind-wandering state in 91 Australian students; the brief mindfulness exercise was free of any mentions about smoking. We found that exposure to the mindfulness-inducing audio clip helped smokers surf their urge when they were later exposed to cigarette cues and they smoked less over the subsequent 7 days. The current work offers empirical evidence for why mindfulness training can be effective in smoking cessation.

Forty healthy volunteers performed movements with their right hand along predefined paths. Each path passed through 2 locations that were defined as either i) the conditioned stimulus (CS+; paired with a painful unconditioned stimulus), or ii) unpaired (CS-). During acquisition phase, participants watched their hand as they moved it. Participants were randomly allocated to an Imprecise group, for whom visual feedback of the hand was offset 30 to 50 mm from its true location, or a Precise group, for whom vision was not disrupted. In the test phase, participants moved their hands to 5 locations—the CS +, CS-, and 3 locations that lay between the 2 (“generalization stimuli”). Our primary hypothesis was supported—pain expectancy was greater at the CS + location in the Imprecise group than in the Precise group (6.9 [SD = 1.9] vs 5.4 [SD = 2.5], P = .02). Pain expectancies generalized to novel locations similarly in both groups and there was no difference in extinction between groups.

"930","Collaborative settings increase dishonesty","The present study examines whether collaborative situations make individuals more dishonest in face-to-face settings. It also considers how this dishonesty unfolds over time. To address these questions, we employed a sequential dyadic die-rolling task in which two participants in a pair sitting face-to-face received a payoff only if both reported the same outcome when each one rolled their die. In each trial, one participant (role A) rolled a die first and reported the outcome. Then, the second participant (role B) was informed of A’s reported number, rolled a die as well, and reported the outcome. If their reported outcomes were identical, both of them received a reward. We also included an individual condition in which an individual subject rolled a die twice and received a reward if he/she reported the same die-roll outcome. We found that B lied significantly more than participants in the individual condition, whereas A lied as much as participants in the individual condition. Furthermore, when collaborating, more and more participants (both A and B) became dishonest as the game progressed, whereas there was no such trend among participants in the individual condition. These findings provide evidence indicating that collaborative settings increase dishonesty and that this effect becomes more evident as the collaboration progress.

"931","Firm beliefs and long-run demand effects in a labor-constrained model of growth and distribution","One of the most debated questions in alternative macroeconomics regards whether demand policies have permanent or merely transitory effects. While demand matters in the long run in (neo-) Kaleckian economics, both economists operating within other Keynesian traditions (e.g. Skott 1989) as well as Classical economists Duménil and Levy (Manchester School 67(6):684–716, 1999) argue that in the long-run output growth is constrained by an exogenous natural growth rate. This paper attempts to bridge the gap by analyzing the role of firm beliefs about the state of the economy in a labor-constrained growth and distribution model based on Kaldor (Review of Economic Studies 23(2):83–100, 1956) and Goodwin (Journal of Evolutionary Economics 1(1):29–47, 1991) that is also compatible with the evolutionary perspective on coordination (or the lack thereof) within markets by Metcalfe et al. (Cambridge Journal of Economics 30:7–32, 2006). The main innovation is the inclusion of beliefs about economic activity in an explicitly dynamic choice of capacity utilization at the firm level. We show that: (i) the relevance of such beliefs generates an inefficiently low utilization rate and labor share in equilibrium, but (ii) the efficient utilization rate can be implemented through fiscal policy. Under exogenous technical change, (iii) the inefficiency does not affect the equilibrium employment rate and growth rate, but expansionary fiscal policy has positive level effects on both GDP and the labor share. However, (iv) with endogenous technical change à la Verdoorn (1949), fiscal policy has also temporary growth effects. Finally, (v) the fact that the choice of utilization responds to income shares has a stabilizing effect on growth cycles, even under exogenous technical change, that is analogous to factor substitution.

"932","Time-based transition expectancy in task switching: Do we need to know the task to switch to?","Recent research has shown that humans are able to implicitly adapt to time-transition contingencies in a task-switching paradigm, indicated by better performance in trials where the task transition (switch vs. repetition) is validly predicted by the pre-target interval compared to trials with invalidly predicted transitions. As participants switched between only two different tasks, not only the transition, but also the specific task was predictable; at least indirectly when taking into account the temporally predicted transition in the current trial together with the task in the previous trial. In order to investigate if the time-based expectancy effect for transition in previous studies was due to a specific task preparation or due to an unspecific transition preparation, three different tasks were used in the present study. One of two possible pre-target intervals (500 and 1500 ms) predicted a task switch in the upcoming trial with 90 % probability, whereas the other interval predicted a task repetition with 90 % probability. Results revealed that participants were able to prepare both upcoming repetition as well as switch requirements based on predictive pre-target intervals. This means that humans seem to be able to prepare a task switch in a rather unspecific manner, most likely by inhibiting the task just performed in the previous trial. By suggesting a two-stage preparation model in which switches as well as repetitions benefit both from time-based transition expectancy, although apparently with different cognitive processes being involved, the present study provides important impulses for future research on the cognitive processes underlying human task-switching behavior.

Previous work in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) has focused on outcomes for task skill training for individual learners. As research extends into intelligent tutoring for teams, both task skills and team skills are necessary for good team performance. This work includes a brief review of previous research on ITTSs, feedback, teams, and teamwork, including the recounting of two categories of a framework of teamwork performance, Communication and Cognition, which are relevant to the present study. This research examines the effects of an intelligent agent, as well as features of the team, its members, and the task being undertaken, on team communication (measured by relevant key-presses) and team situation awareness (as measured by scores on a quiz). Thirty-seven teams of three participants, each at their own computer running a multiplayer surveillance simulation, were given justin- time private (individually delivered) or public (team-delivered) performance feedback during four 5-min trials. In the fourth trial, two of the three participants switched roles. Feedback type, teamwork experience, and teammate familiarity had no statistically significant effect on communication or team situation awareness. However, higher levels of role experience and task experience showed significant and medium-sized effects on communication performance. Results, based on performance data and structured interview responses, also revealed areas of improvement in future feedback design and a potential benchmark for feedback frequency in an action-oriented serious game-based ITTS. Among the conclusions are six design objectives for future ITTSs, establishing a foundation for future research on designing effective ITTSs that train interpersonal skills to nascent teams.

In the Norwegian setting, migrant women are considered by health authorities to be the most difficult group to reach due to cultural and language barriers. Health parties may represent an alternative for bridging these barriers and may create a useful context for active participation and learning about health for migrant women.

"935","Rumination as a mediator of the prospective association between victimization and bullying","Although there is evidence of concurrent associations between victimization and bully perpetration, it is still unclear how this relation unfolds over time. This study investigates whether victimization in childhood is a prospective risk factor for bully perpetration in early adolescence, and examines rumination as a socio-cognitive factor that may mediate this association. Participants included 553 third graders (43.2% boys; M age = 9.85), with follow-up assessments when they were in fourth, seventh, and eighth grade. Results indicated that more frequent victimization in grades 3 and 4 was indirectly associated with bully perpetration in grade 8, through rumination in grade 7 about past victimization experiences in elementary school. This pattern remained regardless of whether the rumination elicited feelings of anger or sadness. Our findings demonstrate one pathway through which frequent victimization can lead to perpetration and underscore the important role of rumination in victims’ subsequent adjustment. Implications for future interventions are discussed.

"936","Utilizing placebos to leverage the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy in patients with depression: Looking below the surface","Comments on an article by Nina Jurinec &amp; A. Schienle (see record 2020-75728-100). Jurinec and Schienle reported a significant improvement in CBT homework compliance (quantitatively and qualitatively) and depression severity with placebo administration. In this study, the placebo was intended to augment an action (the relaxation exercises prescribed). The placebo action identified may have been mediated by the observer expectancy effect, classical conditioning that coupled oil intake with relaxation, and the novelty associated with intake of ""golden root oil"". While Jurinec and Schienle acknowledge the lack of psychophysiological measures to validate relaxation, Suhas, et al believe that there are other concerns about the study and its implications. It is noted that as an additional concern, deliberate deception of study participants may be justifiable to advance scientific theory but would be more challenging to justify in clinical practice. No medicine will ""help patients focus on their inner strengths and mobilize their bodies’ natural healing powers."" Therefore, to say so in order to augment the benefits of CBT would require an unethical deception, compromising the trust that is the basis of the therapist-client relationship.

"937","School-age children can form time-based event expectancy for context-atypical foreperiods","Using a binary choice response task, we compared the formation of time-based event expectancy and its underlying mechanisms between 30 children aged 8–12 and 39 young adults aged 18–35. During a learning phase, two different foreperiods (FPs) predicted the response target’s left or right location with a probability of .8, inducing time-based expectancy. We found that time-based expectancy was developed in school-aged children. However, children showed a significant expectancy effect, especially for context-atypical FPs. In a following test phase, the pairs of FPs changed from shorter to longer, or from longer to shorter, and the target’s location was no longer predictable on the basis of FP duration. Children did not transfer their expectancy from the learning phase to the test phase, suggesting that children, in contrast to adults, do not uniformly employ relative representations of time in time-based expectancy.

"940","The metamemory expectancy illusion in source monitoring affects metamemory control and memory","In source monitoring, schematic expectations affect both memory and metamemory. In metamemory judgments, people predict better source memory for items that originated from an expected source (e.g., oven in the kitchen) than for items that originated from an unexpected source (e.g., hairdryer in the kitchen; expectancy effect ; Schaper et al., 2019a). By contrast, actual source memory is either unaffected by expectations or better for unexpected sources ( inconsistency effect ; Kuhlmann &amp; Bayen, 2016). Thus, the metamemory expectancy effect is illusory. This research is the first to test the hypotheses that such metamemory monitoring of source memory affects metamemory control (i.e., measures taken to achieve a desired level of memory; Nelson &amp; Narens, 1990) and memory. Due to their expectancy illusion, people should choose to restudy unexpected source–item pairs more often. Three participant groups (n = 36 each) studied expected and unexpected source–item pairs. One group rendered metamemory judgments and chose pairs for restudy. A second group made restudy choices only. These two groups then restudied the chosen pairs. A third group did not make restudy choices and restudied a random half of the pairs. All participants completed a source-monitoring test. As predicted, participants chose unexpected pairs more often for restudy based on their illusory conviction that they would remember unexpected sources more poorly. These restudy choices concurred with an inconsistency effect on source memory not shown in the group without restudy choices. Thus, the metamemory illusion related to control and memory in source monitoring.

"941","Balanced placebo design with varenicline: Pharmacological and expectancy effects on medication adherence","Varenicline is one of the most efficacious smoking cessation medications. However, some individuals are unable to adhere to the 12-week medication regimen, primarily due to side effects. Although these side effect may be due to the pharmacological effects of varenicline, there may also be a psychologically rooted explanation (i.e., nocebo effects). Varenicline was once believed to cause serious adverse events and although this has been refuted, concerns regarding its use continue within the general population. This is the first study to differentiate psychological expectancies from pharmacological barriers as it relates to varenicline adherence. Varenicline naïve smokers (N=80) were randomized into a modified balanced placebo design, crossing 2 (given varenicline v. placebo) x 2 (told therapeutic dose v. low dose) to produce four conditions: (1) Told Therapeutic Dose/Varenicline (2) Told Low Dose/Varenicline, (3) Told Therapeutic Dose/Placebo, (4) Told Low Dose/Placebo. Participants self-reported daily medication adherence and other smoking-related outcomes through electronic assessments over two weeks. Results indicated that those in the Told Therapeutic Dose/Varenicline condition had the most stable adherence rates. Conversely, those in the Told Therapeutic Dose/Placebo condition had the sharpest decline in adherence and greatest increase in reported side effects. These reported ""side effects"" were revealed to be a combination of nocebo effects and misattribution nicotine withdrawal symptoms (mainly, nausea, bloating, and increased appetite). Those in the Told Low Dose/Placebo condition provided further evidence that reducing expectations of side effects is associated with higher adherence as well as reduced nocebo effects and withdrawal. Overall, varenicline users who were provided with instructions that reduced expectancies of side effects demonstrated high initial adherence and maintained adherence in the presence of side effects. Ultimately, this suggests that providers would benefit from presenting the potential side effects of varenicline in a careful manner that will diminish negative expectations to help reduce the experience of side effects and improve adherence. Additionally, providing psychoeducation on the temporary nature of withdrawal symptoms may further decrease the likelihood of misattributing minimal withdrawal as a side effect of the medication.

"942","Adolescents’ student engagement as a moderator of the association between bullying role behaviors and internalizing problems","School professionals are charged not only with advancing students' knowledge, but also with developing their social and emotional skills; however, adolescence is a period in which many risk factors are present within a student's environment and a critical goal for school reform is to identify features of the school environment that can be altered to improve student outcomes. The current study investigated associations between bullying participant role behaviors, broad internalizing problems, and student engagement in school. Adolescents (N = 429) completed the following self-report scales: Bullying Participant Behavior Questionnaire (BPBQ; Demaray &amp; Summers, 2008), Student Engagement in School Questionnaire (SESQ; Lam et al., 2012), and Youth-Self Report (YSR; Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001). Regression analyses examined the associations among bullying participant role behaviors (Bully, Assistant, Victim, Defender, Outsider), each type of student engagement (Behavioral, Cognitive, Emotional), and broad internalizing problems. Moderation analyses examined the moderating role of each type of student engagement among the association between bullying participant role behaviors and broad internalizing problems. Implications of the proposed study's findings are described, including how these findings inform school psychological theory and practice. Limitations and future directions are also discussed.

"943","Perceived teacher responses to bullying influence students’ social cognitions","Teachers’ responses to bullying incidents are key in bullying intervention at school. Scholars have suggested that teacher responses can predict student cognitions that are associated with their bullying behaviors. However, little is known about whether and how teacher responses affect these cognitions. Therefore, the current study investigated the effects of four immediate teacher responses on four bullying-related student cognitions, using an experimental vignette design. Additionally, it was examined whether students’ own participant role behaviors in actual bullying moderated these effects. The investigated teacher responses were non-response, comforting the victim, correcting the bully, and a combination of comforting the victim and correcting the bully. The investigated student cognitions were perceived teacher attitudes toward bullying, perceived teacher moral disengagement regarding bullying, student willingness to report bullying to the teacher and student expectations regarding bullying participant role behaviors in the classroom. Fourth-to-sixth grade students ( N = 910; 47% boys; M age = 11.04 years, SD = 0.91) read a vignette describing a hypothetical teacher’s response to a same bullying incident, following random assignment to one of eight conditions (i.e., four teacher responses × two genders of bully and victim in the vignette). Afterward, students completed questionnaires about their social cognitions and manipulation checks. ANOVA demonstrated that students perceived stronger teacher anti-bullying attitudes and less teacher moral disengagement when the hypothetical teacher displayed an active response. These effects were even stronger when the teacher corrected the bully compared to when only the victim was comforted. Further, students were more willing to report bullying when the teacher corrected the bully than when the teacher only comforted the victim. Finally, students expected less pro-bullying behaviors, more defending and less victimization in the vignette’s classroom following active teacher response compared to non-response. The effects of teacher responses on student cognitions were not moderated by students’ own participant roles in bullying. Taken together, these findings emphasize the importance of active teacher responses to bullying, and especially, responses that clearly show that bullying is not tolerated. Teachers are encouraged to be aware that students can deduce beliefs from teacher responses which can, in turn, affect bullying processes in the classroom.

"944","Can theory of mind be improved? Positive expectations cause better theory of mind performance in a community sample","Background and objectives: Theory of Mind (ToM) deficits are present in several mental disorders and closely related to problems in social functioning and lower quality of life. While several trainings are aimed at improving ToM performance, it is unknown whether positive expectations on a persons’ ToM performance might cause better ToM achievement. Methods: Participants ( n = 131) first completed a mock ToM test and were then randomly assigned to either receive standardized positive, negative or no feedback on their ToM performance. Secondly, their expectations on their own ToM performance were assessed. Thirdly, ToM was assessed using the Movie Task for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC). Results: Participants who received positive feedback resulted in positive expectations on their ToM performance and showed enhanced ToM performance, whereas negative feedback did not lead to negative expectations and negative expectations did not affect a change in ToM performance. Limitations: In the present exploratory study, the effect of positive expectations on ToM performance was assessed in a community sample. Thus, the study should be replicated in a clinical sample for more in-depth results. Conclusions: ToM performance could be enhanced by inducing positive expectations on one's ToM performance, whereas negative feedback had no effect. The present study suggest that interventions that focus on strengthening positive expectations on one's ToM performance could enhance the efficacy of present ToM training methods.

"945","Classroom status hierarchy moderates the association between social dominance goals and bullying behavior in middle childhood and early adolescence","Social dominance goals represent desires to be powerful and prominent among peers. Previous studies have documented that endorsing social dominance goals is positively associated with bullying behavior. However, little is known about how classroom context moderates the social dominance goals–bullying association. The present study examined the role of classroom status hierarchy in the longitudinal association between social dominance goals and bullying in a sample of 1,603 children attending 17 grade 3 classrooms ( n = 558, 46.2% girls, M age = 9.33 years, SD = 0.44), 15 grade 4 classrooms ( n = 491, 45.0% girls, M age = 10.31 years, SD = 0.38) and 16 grade 7 classrooms ( n = 554, 49.3% girls, M age = 13.2 years, SD = 0.46) in China, followed for 1 year. Classroom peer status hierarchy was assessed by the within-classroom standard deviation in perceived popularity. Social dominance goals were obtained through self-reports. Bullying was measured via peer nomination. The multilevel models revealed that social dominance goals at Wave 1 predicted increases in bullying at Wave 2 only in classrooms with higher status hierarchies, after controlling for gender, grade, classroom size, and classroom gender distribution. These findings indicate that children who strive for social dominance goals are more likely to bully others when power is less equally distributed in the classroom.

Participants were 574 primary Italian school students from 4th and 5th grade. Measures included self-reported guilt feelings and peer reports of defender and outsider behaviours. Results showed that defenders and outsiders were characterized by different types of guilt. Ethical guilt and a marked lack of happy victimizing (i.e., feeling happy after transgressing) characterized defenders, whereas the link between outsider behaviours and ethical guilt was weaker. Also, outsider males tended to endorse externally dependent feelings of sanction-oriented guilt. Overall, defenders appear to feel and act in others’ defence, whereas the emotions and behaviours of outsiders may be more focused on their own defence.

"947","An examination of bullying roles and moral disengagement using latent analysis","Bullying persists as a concern in schools, including the question of why some children bully. One idea differentiating bullying roles (e.g., bully, victim, bully-victim) is that some individuals are morally disengaged, or able to disconnect their moral understanding and behavior. The present study examined types of bullying involvement and moral disengagement. To address the methodological debate within the bullying literature, the present study used latent analysis. The findings revealed that bullying and victimization behaviors vary by degree of involvement. The present study found that moral disengagement was related to students’ degree of participation in bullying; students in the bully-victim class had the highest levels of moral disengagement, followed by students in the victim class, social victim class, and outsider class. Further research should explore moral engagement as a strategy to enhance anti-bullying efforts.

Results generally suggest that a context relevant instructional set may increase reliability and validity. These findings have not been studied using actual applicants under high-demand conditions such as personnel selection. In the present study, actual police officer applicants completed the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R) using either an “at work” or a standard (no context) frame-of-reference under both high- and low-demand conditions. Results indicated significant demand effects on 3/5 NEO PI-R domain scores and 25/30 facet scores. Frame-of-reference, on the other hand, yielded no significant main effects. An “at work” frame-of-reference, relative to a standard context, had no influence on police officer applicant NEO PI-R responses, irrespective of demand. Context effects on job applicant responses may not be of concern regarding reliability or validity of responding under high-demand conditions such as personnel selection.

The status of commuting in theories dealing with work–family issues or boundary management is not very clear. We discuss commuting taking a different perspective from the literature (e.g., as a demand, source of time-based work–family conflict, impediment to the flexibility and permeability of the work–home boundary, and as a resource for work–family boundary management), concluding that the demand aspects of commuting are dominant. From this perspective, we analyzed the association between the commuting time as a work-related demand at baseline and work–family conflict (WFC), affective commitment (AC), and intention to quit (ITQ) 1 year later ( N = 838). We assessed commuting time objectively by using Google Maps to estimate travel time based on postal codes of home and workplace. As expected, longer commuting predicted all three outcomes. Furthermore, autonomy—manifested in flexible work arrangements—moderated these effects for two out of three outcome variables: Temporospatial autonomy reduced the positive associations between commuting time and WFC and ITQ. The effect sizes were small; however, effects were adjusted for baseline levels of the relevant outcome, demographic variables, and several work and private stressors.

"950","Motivational strategies, working alliance, and protherapeutic behaviors in batterer intervention programs: A randomized controlled trial","Motivational strategies are among the most promising approaches to improve the effectiveness of batterer intervention programs (BIPs). An individualized motivational plan (IMP) is one of these motivational strategies. The present study aimed to explore whether adding an IMP to a standard BIP improved the participant-facilitator working alliance and participants’ protherapeutic behaviors. To this end a randomized controlled trial was conducted. One hundred fifty-three men convicted of intimate partner violence were randomly assigned to either a standard BIP (control condition, n = 79) or a standard BIP plus IMP (experimental condition, n = 74). Working alliance (i.e., general working alliance, agreement, and bond) was assessed with the Working Alliance Inventory-Observer, short version. Protherapeutic behaviors (i.e., assumption of responsibility, participant role behavior, and group value) were assessed with the Observational Coding of Protherapeutic Group Behavior. Both working alliance and protherapeutic behaviors were assessed by an external observer early and late in intervention. Our results showed that both general working alliance and agreement and bond, were significantly higher in the standard BIP plus IMP intervention condition, both early and late in intervention. All protherapeutic behaviors were significantly higher in the standard BIP plus IMP early in intervention, and also late in intervention for assumption of responsibility and group value. Our findings have important practical implications as our results clearly showed that a motivational strategy tool such as the IMP improves key intervention processes (i.e., working alliance and protherapeutic behaviors) in BIPs, therefore increasing their effectiveness.

Jorm (see record 2020-70590-015) regarding the effect of contact-based interventions on stigma and discrimination. Problems with outcome measure choice are addressed. Henderson notes the importance of Jorm's general points about study quality, specifically that reporting is at times inadequate and this makes quality assessment difficult. Henderson questions what study qualities show lasting effects and argues that contact interventions may be likened to medications for long-term conditions. This should not be disregarded because they have a short-term impact. The implication is that contact should be ongoing or repeated to continue to counter the ongoing influence of public stigma. Such contact then begins to resemble having a relationship with someone with a mental health problem, which is strongly associated with having more stigma-related knowledge, more positive attitudes, and less desire for social distance. Henderson also addresses Jorm's logic regarding effect and length of contact in dose effect. Henderson also takes issues with Jorm's attribution of results involving parasocial contact and other forms of nondirect contact to demand effects.

"953","Humans derive task expectancies from sub-second and supra-second interval durations","Recent studies in the field of task switching have shown that humans can base expectancies for tasks on temporal cues. When tasks are predictable based on the duration of the preceding pre-target interval, humans implicitly adapt to this predictability, indicated by better performance in trials with validly compared to invalidly predicted tasks. Yet, it is not clear which internal timing mechanisms are involved. Previous research has suggested that intervals from the sub- and supra-second range are processed by distinct cognitive timing systems. As earlier studies on temporally predictable task switching have used predictive intervals stemming from both ranges, it was not yet clear if the time-based expectancy effect was driven by just one of the two internal timing systems. The present study used clearly sub-second intervals (10 ms and 500 ms) in Experiment 1, while clearly supra-second intervals (1500 ms and 3000 ms) were used in Experiment 2. Substantial adaptation effects were observed in both experiments, showing that sub- as well as supra-second timing systems are involved in time-based expectancies for tasks. The present findings offer important implications for our theoretical understanding of the internal timing mechanisms involved in time-based task expectancy.

"954","The submissive chameleon: Third-party inferences from observing mimicry","Past research has shown that mimicry has a number of pro-social consequences for interaction partners. However, such research has almost exclusively focused on its effects among interaction dyads. As social interactions are often witnessed by third-party observers, the question arises which inferences perceivers draw from observing mimicry. In the present work, we apply a third-party perspective to mimicry and test whether observers perceive mimicking individuals as submissive. Experiment 1 confirmed our prediction and found that observers perceived a mimicking person as less dominant, and thus more submissive, than a mimicked person. Experiment 2 replicated this finding and ruled out possible demand effects. Experiment 3 showed that when an interaction partner does not mimic the movements initiated by another person, the interaction partner gains dominance in the eye of the observer.

"955","Empathy and defending behaviours in school bullying: The mediating role of motivation to defend victims","Background: The literature indicates that separate significant links exist in adolescence between empathy, cognitive and affective motivation to defend victims, and behavioural problems in bullying episode in schools. Aims: The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between empathy, motivation to defend, and defending behaviour in bullying situations. The hypothesis focuses on the possible role of autonomous motivation in the association between empathy and defending attitudes. Samples and methods: Data were collected from 430 Italian adolescents (48.4% male, 51.6% female) who completed a questionnaire in their schools. The mean age of the participants was 13.1 years ( SD = 2.1). Results: Results showed that empathy significantly predicts defending behaviour and also has a significant effect on extrinsic, introjected, and intrinsic motivation to defend. Autonomous motivation, in turn, has a mediating role in the relationship between empathy and defending behaviour. Conclusions: Our study suggests the importance of focusing on empathy and on developing autonomous motivation to defend in children, to raise spontaneous defending attitudes against bullying.

"956","A “defender protective effect” in multiple-role combinations of bullying among Chinese adolescents","Although existing research has advanced our understanding of participant roles in bullying, it is limited by its focus on a single participant role and reliance on samples of children or adolescents in Western nations. Under a “multiple participant roles” perspective based on adaptive strategy hypothesis, the current study used a modified version of the Participant Role Scale approach to identify participant roles in 523 Chinese eighth graders (47.0% boys; M = 14.43) based on peer ratings using two role classification methods: single participant role (using standardized scores) and multiple participant role (using raw scores). First, the single-role method was used. Second, primary, secondary, and tertiary roles were assigned to each adolescent according to his or her three highest scores; they also were assigned to various combinations of roles. Associations between variation in bullying roles and peer social preference (i.e., peer acceptance and rejection) were examined. Overall, the results regarding single-role classification showed that the distribution of and gender differences in roles were consistent with previous studies of Western adolescents. Results regarding multiple-role classification revealed wide variation: primary roles, 85.3% of the sample; secondary roles, 54.2%; tertiary roles, 43.2%. Girls tended to occupy only one role, whereas boys occupied multiple roles. Furthermore, 11 role combinations were identified (e.g., probully-defender; probully-defender-outsider) that were dominated by boys, but also included some girls. Youth whose combination included the role of defender had higher peer acceptance and lower rejection, compared with those without the defender role—a “defender protective effect.” The findings have important implications for understanding and reducing bullying.

"957","Exploring the influence of workplace violence and bystander behaviour on patient safety in Korea: A pilot study","Aims: To explore the influences of clinical nurses’ workplace violence and bystander behaviour on patient safety. Background: Bystanders’ role in social violence affects the consequences of said violence; however, few studies have explored the relationship between workplace violence and patient safety among nurses working in clinical settings. Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was conducted using a structured questionnaire pertaining to workplace violence, bystander behaviour, patient safety culture and nurse-assessed patient safety outcomes. The questionnaire was administered to 185 bedside nurses at a university hospital in a metropolitan city in Korea. Results: A regression model with department, patient safety culture, workplace bullying, incivility and bystander behaviour explained approximately 34.0% of patient safety. Further, defending bystander behaviour, facilitating bystander behaviour, work-related bullying and co-worker incivility influenced the patient safety. Conclusion: Being a facilitating bystander was a threat to patient safety, while being a defending bystander enhanced patient safety. Implications for nursing management: The negative consequences of workplace violence on patient safety may be mitigated by colleagues’ reaction to violence; therefore, nursing policymakers should emphasize the role of positive bystanders as an organisational strategy against workplace violence.

"958","Acute stress impairs reward positivity effect in probabilistic learning","Decision making based on feedback learning requires a series of cognitive processes, including estimating the probability of particular outcomes and modulating expectations between expected versus actual outcomes. It has been suggested that stress affects decision making and subsequent processing of feedback valence and magnitude. However, less is known about the effect of acute stress on reward expectancy. In the current study, participants performed a probabilistic learning task, in which they learned an association between response and feedback within different reward expectancy trials (30% and 70%) under the conditions of stress (threat of shock) and safety (no shock). We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) to measure the reward positivity (RewP) which reflects reward prediction error signals during feedback processing. Behavioral data indicated that participants performed better in the 70% reward trials than in the 30% reward trials. However, no significant difference was observed between stress and safe conditions. Importantly, ERP results indicated that unexpected feedback elicited larger RewP than did expected feedback and this expectancy effect of RewP was reduced in the stress relative to safe condition. Moreover, the correlations between RewP and choice accuracy (70%—30% reward condition) in the safe and stress conditions were in a similar pattern; yet, only in the stress condition the correlation reached significantly. This may indicate that blunted RewP was associated with impaired performance at an individual level. Our study provides ERP evidence that acute stress affects brain responses to reward prediction error processing, which may explain various abnormal learning behaviors associated with stress-related disorders.

"959","Does cyberbullying predict internalizing problems and conduct problems when controlled for traditional bullying?","In this study, relations between cybervictimization and internalizing and conduct problems were analyzed while controlling for traditional victimization. A sample of 701 emerging adults in secondary vocational education completed self-reports about cybervictimization, traditional victimization, internalizing problems and conduct problems. Using multiple regression analyses with heteroscedasticity-consistent estimates, it was found that cybervictimization is related to internalizing and conduct problems while controlling for traditional victimization. The results suggest that cybervictimization is related to both internalizing and conduct problems over and above traditional victimization. The discussion focuses on the need to address bullying and cyberbullying among emerging adults.

"960","Participant roles of peer bystanders in school bullying situations: Evidence from Wuhan, China","Relying on social information processing theory and the transactional model of appraisal and coping, an integrated model was developed to explain how psychological factors and situational factors affect the various participant roles of peer bystanders in school bullying situations. Data were collected through a cross-sectional survey administered to 1491 students (mean age = 13.0 years, range 9–18 years; boys = 52.9%) in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that peer bystanders’ levels of self-efficacy and bullying-related norms were negatively associated with probully behaviors, while empathic concern was a robust predictor of defender behaviors. Three situational variables (popularity, teacher-student interactions, and bullying-related norms) were indirectly associated with defender behaviors and were statistically significant predictors of the three types of appraisals (threat, challenge, and control appraisals) as mediator variables. The model also indicated that two control variables (gender, grade level) were directly and indirectly associated with participant roles of peer bystanders. This study provides empirical support for the importance of understanding peer bystanders in school bullying situations. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

"961","Self-fulfilling prophecies: Documentation of real-world daily alcohol expectancy effects on the experience of specific positive and negative alcohol-related consequences","Alcohol expectancies are consistently associated with alcohol use in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. However, little research has examined whether alcohol expectancies on specific drinking occasions are associated with reported consequences on those days, particularly when controlling for the amount of alcohol consumed, thus differentiating the extent to which reported consequences may have resulted from alcohol or an “expectancy effect.” This study examined consequence-specific daily expectancy effects. College students ( N = 342; mean age 19.7 [standard deviation (SD) = 1.25], 52.9% female) participated in a longitudinal measurement burst study. During four 2-week intervals, participants used mobile phones to respond to 3 surveys per day via automated telephone interviews. The results showed that on days when college students had higher-than-average expectancies for specific subjective positive consequences (e.g., feeling more relaxed, being in a better mood), they were more likely to report experiencing those same consequences as a result of their alcohol use that day, even after controlling for how much they actually drank on that day. The same held true for subjective interpersonal negative consequences (e.g., becoming aggressive, rude, or obnoxious; embarrassing oneself), but not for less subjective physical/cognitive negative consequences (e.g., having a hangover, vomiting, getting hurt/injured, forgetting). The results suggest that one’s expectations about the particular effects of alcohol tend to be self-fulfilling for subjective effects of alcohol even when they are not directly tied to the physiological effects of alcohol. The findings underscore the important role of alcohol expectancies, particularly the expectation of subjective positive social and tension-reduction/relaxation effects, in understanding problematic alcohol use.

It describes the ability to experience or (re)frame everyday situations as stimulating, interesting, and/or entertaining. Playfulness in adolescents is understudied. We collected self-report data on four facets of playfulness (other-directed, lighthearted, intellectual, and whimsical) in two German-speaking samples of adolescents ( N 1 = 210, N 2 = 270; age range 13–18 years). The facets correlated positively, but to varying degrees with life satisfaction (social life, self, friends) and intrinsic goals. There was no relationship with self-reported school grades and achievement goals (Sample 1). Playfulness in girls was associated with peer-nominated (classmates) bullying behaviors and victimization status (Sample 2). Overall, the findings show that playfulness has an impact on various domains of the life of adolescents. We discuss directions for further research in the field.

The sample included 1,266 students in primary (Grades 4–6) and lower secondary (Grades 8–9) schools, who had answered an online questionnaire at two measurement points about 5 months apart and were identified as victims of bullying on the basis of the latter. Only 55.4% of the bullied students had told their situation to someone, and much fewer had told an adult. Telling an adult at home was more common (34.0%) than telling a teacher (20.6%) or some other adult at school (12.7%). In a longitudinal structural equation model (SEM), factors related to increased likelihood of telling an adult were female gender, lower grade level, the chronicity of victimization, perceived negative teacher attitude towards bullying (teacher not tolerating bullying), and perceived peer support for victims (classmates’ tendency to defend students who are victimized).

Legislation and research aimed at supporting transitioning students has led to increased understanding of initiatives that can better support youth and families. Interagency collaboration for transition planning is a key pillar, but evidence-based research in implementation and effects is limited. Through a single-state survey research design, this study aims to identify the levels and perceptions of collaborative factors among transition professionals, specifically educators, Vocational Rehabilitation professionals, and various community supports providers. Variance in perceptions exist among participant role groups, as well as among those professionals with experience serving on formal collaborative planning teams. Educators as a whole report that time and workload barriers affect their ability to collaborate effectively. Additionally, professionals with experience on formal collaborative teams identify that meeting organization strategies are more effective at building collaboration than collaboration skills alone. These findings may be applied to technical assistance providers when developing team-level evaluations to monitor current levels and support needs of collaborative transition planning teams.

"965","Three essays on U.S. Household food and diet preferences","This dissertation focuses on U.S. household food and diet preferences. The first study seeks to determine the effect of rising interest in gluten-free food(s) on retail demand for U.S. foods and ultimately on producer and consumer welfare. Increased interest in gluten-free diets causes a significant decrease in cereals and bakery demand and increases meat, alcoholic beverages, and food away from home demand. Combining estimated demand effects with an equilibrium displacement model suggests the estimated reduction in cereal and bakery demand reduces wheat and barley producer profits by $7.2 million/year. However, after accounting for positive demand impacts on other products, results indicate wheat and barley supply is re-distributed away from food production into animal production, increasing wheat producer welfare. Rising interest in gluten-free is estimated to have increased meat producer welfare by $3.7 billion/year.The purpose of the second study is to provide insight as to what portion of the food resource gap is covered by food assistance programs like SNAP–monetarily and nutritionally. Holding household size constant, least squares means is used to compute and compare mean food expenditures and caloric/macronutrient requirements with Tukey-adjusted difference of means F-tests across household SNAP eligibility/participation statuses. The amount of calories required by each household type is not statistically different. Although SNAP households require fewer calories than non-participating households, they purchase significantly more calories from all foods each week–totaling 45,311 calories. This is 5,478 more calories than required for a healthy diet.The third study seeks to determine whether a new SNAP policy will successfully support endeavors to provide low-income people access to a healthful diet. Changes in weekly caloric consumption by SNAP households are estimated for various products when imposing a 30% reduction in prices for targeted foods. Results suggest discounting the price(s) of targeted foods will indeed increase the demand of these goods; however, total calories consumed by SNAP households will increase by 118–2,661 calories each week (depending on which food is targeted). Because SNAP households currently purchase more calories than are required for a healthy diet, this new policy may not have the desired overall effect.

"966","New teacher induction in international Christian schools: Self-perceptions of administrators and new teachers","This quantitative study with a cross-sectional survey design addressed a gap in the literature regarding induction in international schools, specifically international Christian schools, and replicated two prior studies. The purpose of this study was to identify administrators' and new teachers' self-perceived levels of importance and satisfaction of 34 induction components in their international Christian schools accredited by the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI) and to determine if there were statistically significant differences between administrator and new teacher self-perceptions. In an attempt to conduct a census-type study of the 96 ACSI-accredited international schools, the researcher worked with ACSI to invite participation from each school including one school administrator and all new teachers in their first through third years at the school. The online survey asked participants to rate the importance and satisfaction levels of each induction component, list components they wished would have been included for them, and identify components utilized in their schools that were not addressed in the survey. Data were collected through SurveyMonkey and analyzed through both the quadrant analysis method and independent-samples t tests. The study yielded 14 major findings and multiple recommendations for practice and future research. All 34 components were considered important, although different subgroups of participants considered some to be delivered less than satisfactorily. Quadrant analysis yielded differences by participant role, school geographic location, participant age group, and type of new teacher training. Using a significance level of p &lt; .05, three statistically significant differences (with very large effect sizes) were found between administrators and new teachers regarding importance and satisfaction of new teacher support and satisfaction with training, workshops, and in-service. In most cases, administrators perceived higher ratings than new teachers, except in the following cases where new teachers perceived components to be of higher importance but delivered less satisfactorily: curriculum orientation and training, having a reduced schedule or number of class preparations, and having reduced committee work responsibilities.

"967","The developmental origins of syntactic bootstrapping","Children use syntax to learn verbs, in a process known as syntactic bootstrapping. The structure-mapping account proposes that syntactic bootstrapping begins with a universal bias to map each noun phrase in a sentence onto a participant role in a structured conceptual representation of an event. Equipped with this bias, children interpret the number of noun phrases accompanying a new verb as evidence about the semantic predicate–argument structure of the sentence, and therefore about the meaning of the verb. In this paper, we first review evidence for the structure–mapping account, and then discuss challenges to the account arising from the existence of languages that allow verbs' arguments to be omitted, such as Korean. These challenges prompt us to (a) refine our notion of the distributional learning mechanisms that create representations of sentence structure, and (b) propose that an expectation of discourse continuity allows children to gather linguistic evidence for each verb’s arguments across sentences in a coherent discourse. Taken together, the proposed learning mechanisms and biases sketch a route whereby simple aspects of sentence structure guide verb learning from the start of multi-word sentence comprehension, and do so even if some of the new verb’s arguments are omitted due to discourse redundancy.

"968","Predicting the development of pro-bullying bystander behavior: A short-term longitudinal analysis","Pro-bullying bystander behavior is a key socio-contextual factor underlying the perpetuation of bullying, yet investigators know relatively little as to what contributes to its development. The current study uses a short-term longitudinal design to identify child characteristics and relationship qualities that predict pro-bullying bystander behavior over the course of one school year. Participants were 484 children (239 girls; M age = 10.25 years). Children completed self-report measures of pro-bullying bystander behavior, empathy, moral disengagement, and perceived norms for defending, and peer-report measures of peer victimization and popularity. Main effects of fall empathy and moral disengagement emerged in the prediction of spring pro-bullying bystander behavior, although the latter just for boys. At low levels of perceived norms for defending, high levels of popularity and, for girls, high levels of peer victimization predicted heightened pro-bullying bystander behavior. Thus, anti-bullying efforts may benefit from targeting these social-cognitive and relational processes predictive of pro-bullying bystander behavior and fostering group norms that mitigate these risks.

"969","Stratégies et réactions des victimes et de leur entourage face au harcèlement scolaire: Une étude rétrospective","The negative consequences faced by students who are victims of school bullying are clearly documented. Nevertheless, few studies have examined victim's reactions and strategies to cope with bullying. Yet a better understanding of these reactions would allow a better support from health professionals and to improved prevention actions. This study aims to explore the victim's coping strategies through the content-analysis of 32 interviews conducted with former victims. Given their decisive influence on the bullying's situation, spontaneous or requested reactions of peers, teachers and parents are examined as well. To include these two aspects in a common theoretical framework, this research proposes to combine two distinct approaches: the coping strategies and the Participant Role Approach (Salmivalli, 2010; Salmivalli et al., 1996). The efficiency of each highlighted strategy is analysed and discussed regarding current scientific knowledge. Results suggest that victims generally experiment a large panel of reactions and strategies to cope with bullying. Nevertheless, few of these strategies seem to have an effect on bullying itself, but some can improve the emotional well-being of the victims. Victims who attempted to be liked by their bullies by changing their own behaviour reported no improvement of their relations with the bullies, neither did the ones who used humour in order to get closer to bullies. Bullies didn’t get tired when victims passively endured the bullying, hoping that it would stop by itself. Stand up (verbally or physically) to the bully led to increased bullying (one situation excepted). Physical avoidance of bullies (e.g. staying in classroom during playtimes) allowed some victims to temporarily reduce their emotional distress. Several victims experimented positive interactions with peers in extra-curricular activities (e.g. sport, art, scouting) that helped them recovering confidence in their social skills. Most of victims sought social support at one point of the bullying time. The efficiency of this strategy entirely belongs to the warned person's reaction and is thus highly variable. Based on participants’ report, only increased connectedness with a peer could have an impact on the bullying behaviour through a better integration in the peer-group. On the contrary, parents and teachers’ reactions are often perceived by the victims as not appropriate and as leading to a worse situation. In terms of practical implications, these results highlight the importance of raising teachers and parents’ awareness of the bullying, as well as the significance of the peers group dynamic. Following-up any bullying situation observed or reported in the school would probably help ensuring relevant interventions.

In this paper, we examine TEE in a longitudinal study on a large sample ( N = 1488) of Polish middle-school students and their teachers. Consistent with TEE, teachers’ higher expectations were positively related to students’ math achievement three semesters later, even after controlling for initial achievement. Students’ academic self-concept in math partially mediated the observed effect: teachers’ higher expectations translated into higher students’ academic self-concept, which consequently predicted their higher math achievement. Importantly, TEE was observed not only on the level of individual students, but also on class level. Higher expectations of the entire class improved individual achievements of students in these classes. Teachers’ higher expectations in relation to the potential of classes were observed in classes with higher average socioeconomic status and those without or with only very few students with disabilities. We discuss these findings in light of the mechanisms of TEE.

"971","Classroom size and the prevalence of bullying and victimization: Testing three explanations for the negative association","Classroom size—i.e., the number of students in the class—is a feature of the classroom environment often found to be negatively related to bullying or victimization. This study examines three possible explanations for this negative association: (a) it is due to measurement effects and therefore only found for peer-reports (Hypothesis 1), (b) bullying perpetrators are more popular and have more friends in smaller classrooms (Hypothesis 2), (c) targets of bullying are more popular and have more friends in larger classrooms (Hypothesis 3). Multilevel regression analyses were conducted on a sample from Austria (1,451 students; M age = 12.31; 77 classes) and a sample from the Netherlands (1,460 students; M age = 11.06; 59 classes). Results showed that classroom size was negatively associated with peer-reported bullying and victimization in both samples, and with self-reported bullying and victimization in the Dutch sample only, suggesting partial support for Hypothesis 1. Students high in bullying were found to be more popular in smaller than in larger classrooms in the Austrian sample. The negative link between victimization and popularity was found to be stronger in smaller classrooms than in larger classrooms in the Dutch sample. However, classroom size was not found to moderate links between bullying or victimization and friendship in either sample. Hypotheses 2 and 3 were supported, but only for popularity and in a single sample. Further research is needed to better understand the higher prevalence of bullying found in smaller classrooms in many studies.

Results of a latent profile analysis identified the following roles: defenders, bully–victim–defenders, and students who had low involvement in bullying, victimization, and defending. Results documented significant differences in internalizing problems among the roles. Specifically, bully–victim–defenders reported higher levels of depression and anxiety and lower levels of self-esteem than did defenders and students who had low involvement with bullying scenarios.

The current study used a sample of over 8000 middle- and high-school students (51% female; mean age 12.5 years) from the Rural Adaptation Project in North Carolina to investigate how cumulative experiences as a bullying victim and perpetrator over 5 years, and cumulative experiences of bystander behavior over 2 years impacted students’ aggression, internalizing symptoms, academic achievement, self-esteem, and future optimism. Following multiple imputation, analysis included a Structural Equation Model with excellent model fit. Findings indicate that cumulative bullying victimization was positively associated with aggression and internalizing symptoms, and negatively associated with self-esteem and future optimism. Cumulative bullying perpetration was positively associated with aggression and negatively associated with future optimism. Cumulative negative bystander behavior was positively associated with aggression and internalizing symptoms and negatively associated with academic achievement and future optimism. Cumulative prosocial bystander behavior was positively associated with internalizing symptoms, academic achievement, self-esteem, and future optimism. This integrative model brings together bullying dynamics to provide a comprehensive picture of implications for adolescent behavioral and mental health and academic achievement.

"974","Effects of double-anonymity on pro- and anti-social behavior: Experimental evidence from a lab in the field","This paper examines whether different degrees of subject-experimenter anonymity influence pro- and anti-social behavior in lab-in-the-field experiments. To do this, a Dictator Game (DG) and a Joy-of-Destruction Mini-Game (JoD) were conducted with 480 subjects in rural Namibia. In addition to a strict double-anonymous treatment two single-anonymous treatments are introduced. One of them involves the disclosure of decisions directly to the experimenter. Thereby, it is possible to disentangle the effect of pure double-anonymity from the procedure of the decision-making. The presented results carry relevant implications for a methodologically sound implementation of lab-in-the-field experiments. Both in the DG and JoD, strict double-anonymous procedures do not produce significantly different behavior than under single-anonymity. Whether revealing decisions personally to the experimenter influences individual behavior cannot be consistently answered with the obtained results. The personal disclosure leads to significantly more pro-social and less anti-social behavior in one out of two treatment comparisons. From a conservative perspective, researchers are however advised to assure sufficient privacy for subjects from experimenters during the decision-making process.

"975","Metacognitive expectancy effects in source monitoring: Beliefs, in-the-moment experiences, or both?","Judgments of Learning (JOLs) may result from a priori beliefs and in-the-moment experiences (cue-utilization approach, Koriat, 1997). The authors investigated the interplay and relative importance of beliefs and experiences, and their impact on JOLs and Judgments of Source (JOS). In a source-monitoring task with expected and unexpected source–item pairs (e.g., kitchen–oven vs. bathroom–refrigerator), metamemory judgments were higher for expected than unexpected pairs ( expectancy effect ). In two experiments, beliefs and experiences independently contributed to the expectancy effects on JOLs and JOSs. A priori beliefs regarding item and source memory for expected and unexpected source–item pairs were heterogeneous and partially moderated the expectancy effects on JOLs and JOSs. In Experiment 2, experiences captured via study time mediated the expectancy effect on JOLs only. Beliefs and experiences were weighted differently in JOLs versus JOSs. Results highlight the importance of investigating different metamemory processes and their contributions to different judgments.

"976","Beta-gamma oscillation reveals learning from unexpected reward in learners versus non-learners","Beta-gamma oscillation has been demonstrated to be sensitive to unexpected reward feedback. However, it remains unclear whether beta-gamma activity manifests individual differences in reinforcement learning processing. Given that individuals differ largely in reinforcement learning tasks, we adapted the Friedland task and split subjects into two groups: learners who learned to choose the optimal card after training and non-learners who did not learn well. We used recorded electroencephalography signals to test the difference in brain activity between the learners and non-learners groups when participants conducted a time estimation task and received win and loss feedback in expected and unexpected conditions. The results revealed that the unexpected condition elicited a larger reward positivity amplitude than did the expected condition, but only in the learners group. No significant difference was found between the two groups for the expectancy effect on frontal-midline theta. The current results thus demonstrate that for learners, unexpected win feedback elicits a larger beta-gamma oscillation than expected win feedback, while this was not the case for non-learners. These results indicate that beta-gamma oscillation may reflect effective learning from positive reward prediction error, a finding that adds to the existing theories on learning processes.

"977","Bullying immigrant versus non-immigrant peers: Moral disengagement and participant roles","This study examined (1) whether self-justifying bullying (i.e., moral disengagement) differs in hypothetical bullying situations of a newcomer peer depending on his or her immigrant status; and (2) whether the respondent's immigration status, age, gender, real life bullying participant role (as bully, assistant, reinforcer, defender, victim or outsider) and moral disengagement proneness moderate the differences in moral disengagement between non-immigrant vs. immigrant victims. Altogether, 342 ten-year olds (54% immigrants) and 292 twelve-year olds (45% immigrants) answered peer-report measures to assess participation in bullying and peer status, and self-report measures to assess moral disengagement proneness and situational moral disengagement related to vignettes in which the target of bullying was a non-immigrant vs an immigrant new classmate. For both non-immigrant and immigrant participants both types of moral disengagement were higher for non-immigrant than immigrant victims in the vignettes independent of the respondents' own immigration status. However, different participant bullying roles predicted the differences in moral disengagement between non-immigrant versus immigrant hypothetical victims among non-immigrant and immigrant students. Results suggest that, besides being a trait dimension, moral disengagement is also influenced by situational characteristics that need to be taken into account in order to prevent and tackle bullying effectively.

"978","Self-blame tendency of bullied victims in elementary and secondary schools","The current scales for self-blame are not suitable for school bullying scenarios and most lack validity. This study used a self-developed scale to measure bullied victims’ tendency to self-blame and further examined whether victims and bully/victims exhibited different tendencies toward self-blame under both bullied and generalized scenarios. The study consisted of 1,320 student participants from grades five to nine. The research instrument was a self-constructed bullied-victim self-blame scale (BSS), and the results were analyzed using the Rasch rating scale model. The Rasch results showed strong evidence of BSS reliability and validity. The results indicated that participants’ self-blaming tendency scores were positively correlated with depression ( r = .31). In addition, participants’ self-blaming scores in relational bullying were higher than those in verbal and physical bullying. The self-blaming tendency of bully/victims under bullied scenarios was higher than that of victims, but no difference was found between bully/victims and victims for generalised scenarios. The participants’ tendency to self-blame under generalised scenarios was significantly higher than under bullied scenarios. The tendencies of various roles to self-blame under different scenarios and the self-blaming counselling strategies for victims are discussed at the end of this study.

In a following step, 118 of them voluntarily decided to become peer educators. Probit regression separate for gender, showed that male peer educators have a higher level of victimization, perceived support from friends and prosocial behaviour. On the other hand, female peer educators are characterized by a higher level of defending behaviours. These findings may guide further investigation about the role of peer educator in regards to bullying and cyberbullying prevention and intervention programs.

"980","How do time limits affect our psychotherapies? A literature review","The application of time limits (i.e. restricting the amount of sessions before the beginning of psychotherapy) has become ingrained in psychotherapy research and in the context of managed care, mostly due to pragmatic and economic reasons. However, little is know on how this technique interferes with the psychotherapeutic process. Although several theorists have considered the possible advantages and drawbacks of the technique, research explaining these mechanisms is scattered. By conducting this review, we strived to answer two questions: (1) Does a time limit alter the psychotherapeutic process? And (2) In what way? In doing so, this study aspires to grant more insight into the mechanisms of time limited psychotherapy and aimes to contribute to a first understanding of the dynamics of a time restricted therapy process. We searched for articles in the databases of Web of Science and Pubmed. Our review identified 28 studies that provide empirical grounds to explain processes involved when applying a time limit to psychotherapy. Qualitative research suggests that a time limit exerts pressure on the therapy process and creates an expectancy effect, which can have both positive and negative consequences. Additionally, time limits can be associated to therapists taking on a more directive role in therapy. Results show that a time limit is anything but a neutral intervention; it is a technique that complexly interacts with therapy processes on multiple grounds. Further research is vital to determine which environment is appropriate for its application.

"981","Examining cross-cultural differences in youth's moral perceptions of cyberbullying","Cyberbullying has captured attention around the globe with research taking place in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. However, few of these studies have compared children and adolescents from countries with diverse cultural backgrounds, with research on Middle Eastern countries remaining scarce. To examine the influence of culture, gender, and participant roles in cyberbullying (bystander vs. perpetrator) on children and adolescents' moral evaluations of hypothetical cyberbullying events, participants read and evaluated four vignettes. Three sets of data were collected in Canada ( n = 100), China ( n = 100), and Iran ( n = 101). Participants ( N = 300; 49 percent male) were between 8 and 16 years of age ( M = 11.73; standard deviation = 0.76). Two vignettes considered the perspective of a perpetrator, whereas the two others considered the perspective of a bystander. A repeated-measures analysis of variance showed that youth from Iran evaluated cyberbullying events less negatively than Canadian and Chinese youth. Regardless of culture, females evaluated cyberbullying events more negatively than males. Persian youth evaluated cyberbullying less negatively than Canadian and Chinese youth. With age, participants attributed less shame to cyberbullying behaviors. However, Chinese and Persian youth attributed more hubristic pride than Canadian youth with age. Also, Canadian and Chinese children rated perpetrator behaviors more negatively than their Persian counterparts. However, bystander behaviors were similarly negatively rated across cultures. This study breaks new ground by examining moral evaluations of cyberbullying according to participant role, culture, and gender. Findings from this study may be helpful to educators and policymakers to strengthen moral and diversity education in schools to help mitigate cyberbullying events.

"982","Contribution of sociodemographic factors to different engagement of children in peer violence","Peer violence among children continues to rise both in Croatia and around the world, and it represents a serious global problem. Children can be engaged in peer violence in the roles of bullies, victims, active assistants, reinforcers, defenders, and bystanders. The purpose of this article was to examine the role of sociodemographic factors (gender, age, grade, school achievement, mother's and father's education level and income, and socioeconomic status of the family) contributing to different engagement of children in peer violence. A total of 715 seventh- and eighth-grade students, aged between 12 and 15 years, from five regions of the Republic of Croatia participated in this study. A descriptive analysis showed that the majority of children perceived themselves in the role of defenders, then bystanders, victims, reinforcers, active assistants, and fewest perceived themselves in the role of bullies. A correlation analysis showed that bullies, assistants, and bystanders were more often boys, while girls were more often defenders. Both genders were equally victims of peer violence. Seventh-grade students were more inclined to be bullies. A regression analysis conducted for each role showed that different sociodemographic factors predicted different engagement of children in peer violence. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that sociodemographic factors play an important role in different engagement of children in peer violence, which could play a crucial role in developing prevention programs aimed at reducing and preventing peer violence.

"983","Problematic attention processing and fear learning in adolescent anxiety: Testing a combined cognitive and learning processes model","Background and objectives: Anxiety in adolescence is characterised by disturbances in attentional processes and the overgeneralisation of fear, however, little is known about the combined and reciprocal effects of and between these factors on youth anxiety. The present study investigated whether attention (attention allocation and control) and fear generalisation processes together predict more variance on adolescent anxiety symptoms than each factor in isolation, and explored their interrelations. Methods: 197 adolescents completed a novel conditioning task, which paired balloon cues with mildly aversive or neutral outcomes. A spatial cueing task, and self-report measures of emotional attentional control and anxiety, were also completed. Results: Threat-avoidant attention allocation biases, impaired attention control, and exaggerated fear generalisation together predicted greater variance in anxiety symptoms (55.3%), than each set of fear and attention processes in isolation. Results also provided evidence of an interplay between these factors. Individual differences in threat-avoidant attention allocation biases predicted variability in the generalisation of fear, whilst the association between heightened anxiety and the overgeneralization of fear was moderated by poor attention control. Conclusions: This study provides unique evidence of the combined effects of attention and fear generalisation mechanisms in explaining youth anxiety, and interrelations between these factors. Importantly, results suggested that deficiencies in attention control may bring out anxiety-associated impairments in fear generalisation. Limitations: We relied on self-reported ratings of fear during generalization and also of attention control. Thus demand effects cannot be discounted. Reaction-time measures of attention focus are also indirect assessments of attention that may lack precision.

"984","Thou shalt not steal: Taking aversion with legal property claims","Do people have an innate respect for property? In the literature, there is controversy about whether human subjects are taking averse . We implemented a dictator game with a symmetric action space to address potential misconceptions and framing and demand effects that may be responsible for the contradictory findings. Misconceptions can occur as a result of unclear property rights, while framing and demand effects can occur if anonymity is not preserved. Our paper is the first to implement both a strict double-blind anonymity protocol and clear property rights. We established clear property claims by asking subjects in our legal treatment to bring their own property to the experiment. In the effort treatment, the experimenter transferred the property publicly to subjects after they completed a real effort task. Our data suggest that without social enforcement, respect for property is low. Yet, the taking rate significantly differs from the theoretically predicted maximum. Consistent with the Lockean theory of property, respect for property grows when the entitlement is legitimized by the labor the owner had to invest to acquire it.

"985","Not just nonspecific factors: The roles of alliance and expectancy in treatment, and their neurobiological underpinnings","Therapeutic factors such as alliance and expectancy have been found to greatly affect treatment outcome in both psychotherapy and psychopharmacotherapy. Often, these factors are referred to as nonspecific because of their common roles across treatment modalities. Here we argue that conceptualizing such factors as nonspecific is not accurate at best, misleading at worst and may undermine treatment outcome across various modalities. We argue that alliance and expectancy contain both a trait-like common factor component and a state-like specific effect, and that it is clinically, conceptually and methodologically critical to disentangle the two. In other words, both alliance and expectancy may also function as active ingredients of treatment, leading to better outcome. We review the literature regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of alliance and of the expectancy effect, and suggest how future studies on the neurobiological basis of these effects can shed further light on the potentially distinct mechanisms of the trait-like and state-like components of each therapeutic factor.

"986","The effect of money priming on self-focus in the imitation-inhibition task: A registered report","The self-sufficiency hypothesis suggests that priming individuals with money makes them focus more strongly on themselves than on others. However, recently, research supporting this claim has been heavily criticized and some attempts to replicate have failed. A reason for the inconsistent findings in the field may lay in the common use of explicit measures, because they tend to rely on one or just a few items and are thus prone to demand effects and low reliability. In the present research, we administered, in two experiments, the imitation-inhibition task – a robust, unobtrusive, and reliable paradigm that is sensitive to self-other focus on a trial-by-trial basis. A pilot study found an increased focus on the self as compared to others when primed with money. Building on this finding, a preregistered high-powered experiment replicated this effect, suggesting that money primes may indeed increase a focus on the self. An additionally carried out meta-analysis indicates that automatic imitation is modulated by self-other focus and that money primes lead to a smaller focus on the self than conventional methods. Overall, the found effects are rather small and several limitations, such as order effects, call for a cautious interpretation of the findings.

"987","The impact of bullying participant role on the relationship between school climate and attitudes towards interpersonal peer violence","Positive school climate has been linked to lower levels of school violence and interpersonal conflict. Interventions that impact school climate have been shown to powerfully impact school violence and bullying prevalence. The current study used data collected from three middle schools in the same Rocky Mountain town. The survey tool contained items asking students about their behaviors when confronted with interpersonal conflict such as bullying, their attitudes towards interpersonal conflict, and their perceptions of their school's climate. Significant differences were found between genders on attitudes towards interpersonal peer violence but no differences were found in the distribution of genders across participant roles. In addition, significant differences were found between bullying participant roles on both attitudes towards interpersonal peer violence and in perceptions of school climate. Finally, a moderated regression revealed a significantly stronger relationship between attitudes towards interpersonal peer violence and school climate in the defender group compared to other participant roles. This study contributes to the knowledge base surrounding school climate and will assist those who design school climate interventions in developing a more nuanced approach for reducing bullying and challenging students' attitudes about the acceptability of interpersonal peer violence.

"988","Effects of plausibility and predictability on reading: How and why they differ","This dissertation is concerned with how world knowledge (plausibility) affects reading beyond how predictable what comes next is. Previous studies have explained the effect of plausibility in terms of probability, either because plausibility is the conditional probability of a role filler given what precedes or because plausibility affects reading through predictability. This thesis proposes that plausibility does not reduce to predictability. Instead, I will argue that the effect of world knowledge on reading can be explained in terms of the semantic similarity between the actual input and other possible words that could have been used. I first show that predictability (as estimated through a cloze task) does not explain plausibility (as estimated via a plausibility judgment task) when a more precise measure of predictability is used and materials have a wider range of predictability scores. Second, I show that plausibility affects reading time later than predictability, suggesting that the mechanism underlying the effect of plausibility on reading differs from the one underlying the effect of predictability. Third, I show that inferred information about how participants in events are socially related can also affect plausibility and reading. Finally, I show that plausibility can be partly explained as how close a participant role filler is to the medoid of the semantic cluster that the input belongs to. Overall, the studies reported in this dissertation show that plausibility is not reducible to predictability and that the plausibility of event descriptions corresponds, in part, to how semantically related what is read is to other event participants in the same ad-hoc semantic domain.

"989","Company employees as experimental participants in traffic safety research: Prevalence and implications","The use of company employees as experimental participants when testing products, technology or paradigms developed by the same company raises questions about bias in results and research ethics. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of studies authored by car company researchers with car company employees as participants, to assess the risk of bias in such studies, to investigate journal editors’ opinions in the field of traffic safety regarding these procedures, and to offer a general discussion about ethical and methodological implications. Three types of data were collected. We (i) examined guidelines and recommendations for authors in eleven selected peer-reviewed journals in the area of traffic safety; (ii) surveyed editors of these journals; and (iii) reviewed articles authored by researchers from a selected group of car manufacturers and published in these journals during 2011–2015. Guidelines and recommendations for authors in the included journals did not mention whether and under what circumstances company employees can be research participants, nor did publishers’ general guidelines. However, three out of the four editors who responded to our survey believed that this issue of private company researchers using participants from the same company deserves to be explicitly addressed in their journal’s guide for authors. The total number of regular articles and conference papers during 2011–2015 in the eleven journals reviewed was 6763; 95 (1.4%) listed at least one car manufacturer in the authors’ affiliations; and out of these, nine included company employees as participants. In summary, company employees are seldom (0.13%) used as research participants in traffic safety research. Nevertheless, the use of company employees as research participants raises questions about bias in results as well as about incursions into the participants’ autonomy.

"990","Understanding relational and physical bullying profiles: The importance of school climate and social status","Cross-national studies consistently reveal that bullying is a pervasive problem in schools and associated with a multitude of deleterious outcomes. The present dissertation conducted two studies to further provide insight into this complex phenomenon and facilitate the development of effective bullying prevention programs. Youth involved in bullying have historically been assigned to fixed bully participant roles (i.e., bully, victim, defender, and bystander) using classification systems based on relatively arbitrary cut off scores. Latent class analysis (LCA) was utilize in the first study to empirically identify bully participant role profiles in seventh and eighth grade based on assuming multiple bully participant roles at varying degrees. Four separate LCA models were run, two relational bullying LCAs and two physical bullying LCAs split by gender. Among female students, a four-class model emerged for both the relational and physical LCAs. Regarding males, a three-class model emerged for both the relational and physical LCAs. All four LCAs yielded a High Involvement class and a Low Involvement class. Concerning females, there was a consistent third class, called Defender, in both the relational and physical LCAs. However, the fourth class in the females' relational LCA was called Victim Defender while in the physical LCA, the fourth class was call Bystander/Defender. Among males, the third class in the relational LCA was called Defender, but the third class in the physical LCA was called Victim. Overall, these findings build upon previous research on bully participant roles by demonstrating that students can assume multiple roles simultaneously and at varying degrees. In addition, this study revealed gender specific effects that varied according to whether the bullying was physical or relational. To broaden our understanding of how socio-ecological factors influence bullying, a second study investigated how the bullying profiles identified in Study 1 relate to school climate factors and perceptions of social status. Specifically, three school climate factors were examined, including school-wide efforts to reduce bullying, student knowledge of how to address bullying, and direct communication between students and school staff about bullying. The two components of social status were self-reported levels of popularity and likability. Overall, across all four LCAs, self-perceived likability significantly predicted class membership. Self-perceived popularity significantly predicted class membership for male students and the physical LCA only. In terms of the school climate factors, all three components significantly predicted class membership among female students, for both physical and relational bullying. The school climate factors did not significantly predict group membership among male students for either physical or relational bullying. These findings suggest that the impact of socio-ecological factors on bullying is nuanced and complex, as it varied by gender and type of bullying. Understanding these nuances can help inform practitioners designing interventions that target the multifaceted needs of students involved in bullying.

"991","Historic sex-ratio imbalances predict female participation in the market for politicians","We analyze the long-term effects of gender imbalances on female labor force participation, in particular in the market for politicians. We exploit variation in sex ratios—the number of men divided by the number of women in a region—across Germany induced by WWII. In the 1990 elections, women were more likely to run for office in constituencies that had relatively fewer men in 1946. We do not find a significant effect of the sex ratio on the likelihood of a woman winning the election. These results suggest that while women were more likely to run for a seat in parliament in constituencies with lower historical sex ratios, voters were not more inclined to vote for them.

"992","(un)great expectations: The role of placebo effects in cognitive training","A growing body of literature demonstrating the malleability of critical higher-order cognitive functions by means of targeted interventions has incited widespread scientific interest, most notably in the form of cognitive training programs. The results are mixed and a point of contention: It has been argued that gains observed in cognitive training are mainly due to placebo effects. To address this, we examined the effect of participant expectations on one type of cognitive training that has been central to the controversy, namely n -back training, by inducing beliefs about expected outcomes. Participants receiving n -back training showed improvements in non-trained n -back performance regardless of expectations, and furthermore, expectations for positive outcomes did not result in any significant gains in an active control group. Thus, there was no detectable expectancy effect in either direction as a function of the cognitive intervention used, suggesting that training-related improvements are unlikely due solely to a placebo effect.

"993","Relations between restorative parental discipline, family climate, parental support, empathy, shame, and defenders in bullying","This study examined the associations among restorative parental discipline, family climate, parental support, moral emotions (empathy and shame), and the role of defenders in bullying. In total, 1224 adolescents were randomly selected ( p = .5, q = 95%); 54.1% were female, and 45.9% males. The age of research participants ranged between 11 and 15 years old ( M = 13.5, SD = 1.02). A model of structural equations was calculated. The results found restorative parental discipline, family climate, and parental support were directly and indirectly related to empathy, shame, and the adoption of defender role in bullying. A multi-group analyses indicated that gender did not moderate the developed model for restorative discipline but did have interesting results. Findings suggest that positive parenting is important to stimulate moral emotions and the defenders' role.

"994","The “jay-dar” phenomenon: Individuals discriminate cannabis users from nonusers based upon a photograph","Objective: With increasing legalization of medicinal and recreational cannabis, use is on the rise. Research suggests individuals may be able to guess cannabis user status based upon appearance; however, these findings utilized a small sample of photographs that was not balanced on user status or gender. Further, no studies examined whether raters with cannabis experience are better at judging others' cannabis use, or what physical features they use to make these judgments. This study explored these factors using a larger, balanced photograph database. Method: An American sample ( n = 249, 48.6% female, mean age = 35.19 years) rated 36 photographs (18 cannabis users, 18 nonusers) balanced on gender and age on the likelihood that the photographed individuals use cannabis, producing 8964 ratings. Respondents also reported physical features considered in their ratings, as well as their own cannabis use history. Results: As hypothesized, photographs of users received higher ratings on the Marijuana Use Likelihood Index relative to nonusers. Further, results revealed a gender by rater user status interaction, indicating that raters with no previous cannabis experience rated males higher than females, while raters with cannabis experience did not demonstrate this rating discrepancy. Cannabis use explained over 9% of the variance in ratings across all photographs. Conclusions: Results suggest individuals do rate cannabis users as more likely to be users, relative to nonusers, based upon appearance alone. These findings have important implications, not only for research on chronic cannabis use effects, but also for social and achievement factors such as potential stigma.

"995","The participant roles of bullying in different grades: Prevalence and social status profiles","This study examined grade differences in the social status profiles and prevalence of bullying participant roles. Participants were 598 primary school students (grades 4–6), 545 students in the lower-grades of secondary school (grades 7–8), and 1491 students in the upper-grades of secondary school (grades 9–11). Students' participant roles, popularity, and social preference were measured with peer nominations. Bullies, assistants, and reinforcers (i.e., bullies/followers) were as popular as defenders in primary school, but more popular than defenders in secondary school. These differences depended on the gender of the reference group. Bullies/followers were more popular than defenders among other-gender peers in the lower-grades of secondary school but not among same-gender peers. In the upper-grades of secondary school, bullies/followers were more popular than defenders among all peers. Grade differences in social preference were small. The grade differences in popularity profiles of the roles were in line with grade differences in prevalence rates. Bully/follower roles were more common in secondary school than primary school among girls and the defender role was less common in secondary school among boys. This suggests that bully/follower roles are more rewarded with social status in secondary school than in primary school.

"996","Don't judge a book by its cover: Examiner expectancy effects predict neuropsychological performance for individuals judged as chronic cannabis users","Objective: The experimenter expectancy effect confound remains largely unexplored in neuropsychological research and has never been investigated among cannabis users. This study investigated whether examiner expectancies of cannabis user status affected examinees’ neuropsychological performance. Method: Participants included 41 cannabis users and 20 non-users. Before testing, examiners who were blind to participant user status privately rated whether they believed the examinee was a cannabis user or non-user. Examiners then administered a battery of neuropsychological and performance validity measures. Multiple regression analyses compared performance between examinees judged as cannabis users ( n = 37) and those judged as non-users ( n = 24). Results: Examiners’ judgments of cannabis users were 75% accurate; judgments of non-users were at chance. After controlling for age, gender, and actual user status, examiner judgments of cannabis user status predicted performance on two measures (California Verbal Learning Test-II, and Trail Making Test B; p &lt; .05), as individuals judged as cannabis users obtained lower scores than those judged as non-users. Conclusions: Examiners’ judgments of cannabis user status predicted performance even after controlling for actual user status, indicating vulnerability to examiner expectancy effects. These findings have important implications for both research and clinical settings, as scores may partially reflect examiners’ expectations regarding cannabis effects rather than participants’ cognitive abilities. These results demonstrate the need for expectancy effect research in the neuropsychological assessment of all populations, not just cannabis users.

"997","Peer influence in bullying: The autonomy-enhancing effect of moral competence","Research has found that moral competence is negatively associated with bullying behavior in schools, but the drivers of this association are not yet well understood. In this paper, we report on two studies which suggest that moral competence acts as a moderator of peer influence in the context of school bullying. Data were collected at two time points in three German higher secondary schools (grades 7–10, average age at measurement: 14.26 years). Using a cross-lagged panel design (CLPD), study 1 ( N = 251) found adolescents with low moral competence to be susceptible to peer influence, while no such effect was found for adolescents with high moral competence. Study 2, a cross-sectional analysis ( N = 748), found moral competence to be inversely related to the likelihood of an individual's conforming with the pro-bullying behavior of his or her peers. Neither study found corresponding effects for pro-social, defending behavior. Our findings further illuminate the associations between moral competence, peer influence, and school bullying. Some implications for bullying prevention are discussed.

"998","Self-control demands and alcohol-related problems: Within- and between-person associations","This study tested a multilevel structural model of associations between two aspects of self-control (effortful control and reactivity), self-control demands, alcohol consumption, and alcohol problems and related risk behaviors using daily diary data from 196 young adults (4,177 person-days). Self-control demands were hypothesized to be positively associated with alcohol consumption and alcohol problems and related risk behaviors both within- and between-persons. At the between-person level, self-control demands were hypothesized to mediate the association between trait self-control and alcohol problems and related risk behaviors. At the within-person level, self-control demands had a direct positive effect on alcohol problems and related risk behaviors, over and above alcohol consumption. However, contrary to expectation, self-control demands were inversely associated with alcohol consumption. In contrast, self-control demands were positively associated with alcohol consumption at the between-person level and partially mediated the positive effects of reactivity on consumption and alcohol problems and related risk behaviors. That is, reactivity was associated with higher perceived self-control demands, which in turn predicted higher rates of consumption and alcohol problems and related risk behaviors. Effortful control was not significantly associated with alcohol consumption or self-control demands. The pattern of self-control demand effects at the within-person level suggest that young adults are less likely to drink when struggling to manage their day-to-day behavior, yet if they do drink they are more susceptible to negative consequences. Trait effects suggest that individual differences in self-control may be associated with alcohol use patterns in part attributable to development of, and response to, structured daily routines.

"999","Defending victims of bullying in early adolescence: A multilevel analysis","Adolescents’ defending behaviors in school bullying situations is likely determined by individual characteristics, social status variables, and classroom/school contextual factors operating simultaneously in the peer ecology. However, there is little research on defending behavior that utilizes this multilevel approach. This study investigated how students’ willingness to defend victims of bullying was affected by feelings of empathy, perceived popularity, and classroom-level perceived prosocial norms. Participants were 1373 adolescents (40% girls, M age: 14 yrs) from 54 classrooms in six middle schools in South Korea. These youth reported on their feelings of empathy and how prosocial they perceived their classmates to be. Peer-ratings and peer nominations were used to estimate defending behaviors and which students were perceived as popular. Multilevel analyses showed that participants were more likely to defend victims when they had greater empathy and perceived popularity and when classroom-level prosocial norms were higher. The findings have implications for interventions to reduce school bullying and for studying defending behavior in multiple cultural contexts.

"1000","The effect of monetary compensation on cognitive training outcomes","Recent work has established the possibility that messaging and incentive during recruitment may influence the outcome of cognitive training. These factors may impact intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to complete a training intervention, and one provocative single session study suggests that recruitment messaging may be responsible for an expectancy effect in certain training experiments. To examine the effects of payment and payment messaging during recruitment on a longer training program, participants were recruited to complete a twenty-session working memory regimen with or without payment, and with messaging that either emphasized payment or improving cognition. Significant group differences were observed at baseline; unpaid participants reported a significantly higher number of cognitive failures compared to compensated participants. However, both paid and unpaid training groups improved on transfer measures compared to an active control group, and payment had no effect on transfer. An additional post-test survey within the compensated group revealed different motivational orientations that were associated with significant performance differences on the visuospatial reasoning factor at baseline. While these differences in motivation were not predictive of transfer or training gain, it is possible that other elements of the study, including researcher involvement, may also play a role in determining the extent to which participants demonstrate transfer on untrained tasks. We conclude that while payment and recruitment messaging may affect training and transfer performance to some degree, a variety of additional factors likely contribute to the outcome of any individual study and the influence of certain factors may matter less during a longer-term program.

"1001","Bullying, defending, and outsider behaviors: The moderating role of social status and gender in their relationship with empathy","The aim of the present study was to examine whether the effect of empathy on the role children play in bullying situations, as either bullies, defenders or outsiders, was moderated by children's social status within their classroom, and whether this moderation was gender dependent. For this purpose, we used a representative sample of 2,050 Spanish primary school children (50.80% girls) from grades 3–6 ( M age = 9.80 years; SD = 1.24), recruited from 27 primary schools. Results showed that the effect of empathy on bullying behavior was moderated by the sociometric rating only in girls. Both empathy and social rating had an effect on defending behavior. However, neither the children's sociometric rating nor their gender moderated the relationship between empathy and defending and outsider behaviors. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for interventions designed to prevent bullying in school settings.

"1002","Predicting behaviour: Comparing the performance of factual versus attitudinal approaches","Despite years of refinement and improvement to questionnaire design, the need remains to identify effective, but ‘user-friendly’ questioning procedures to predict behaviour, without compromising predictive performance. Questionnaires developed to predict behaviour typically use an attitudinal approach. However, those types of questionnaires are associated with increased respondent fatigue, decreased question comprehension, opposition to question tone and demand effects. An alternative approach involves use of factual questions. This study compares ease of application in the field as well as predictive performance of the two approaches to questionnaire design in the context of predicting willingness to donate blood. Results indicate that factual questions are quicker and easier to apply in the field than attitudinal questions, while predictive performance of the approaches is equivalent.

The results of the exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis made it possible to obtain a reduced factorial structure with three latent factors: social values, personal values, and individualistic values. Evidence of reliability due to internal coherence was favorable. The conclusion is that despite the significant reduction of items and first-order dimensions, the EVDPA delivers sufficient evidence and can be used in the population of Chilean adolescent students.

Second, we examined the association between reports of relational aggression and victimization and bystander intervention styles. Third, we estimated relationships between the different bystander intervention styles, by examining two directional paths. Participants were 1,518 adolescents (61.9% boys, 38.1% girls) from 15 Israeli religious and secular middle and high schools. The data analysis indicated two new intervention styles: help-seeker and passive bystander. Two structural models, illustrating the path leading to and from provictim and antivictim bystander intervention styles are presented. The distinction between the “participant-role approach” and the bullying circle is discussed in order to address the theoretical difference between social categorization of fixed bystander roles as opposed to rating bystander intervention styles on a continuum.

"1006","Demand effects of consumers’ stated and revealed preferences","Knowledge of how consumers react to different signals is fundamental to understanding how markets work. The modern electronic marketplace has revolutionized the possibilities for consumers to gather detailed information about products and services before purchase. Specifically, a consumer can easily—through a host of online forums and evaluation sites—estimate a product’s quality based on either (i) what other users say about the product ( stated preferences ) or (ii) how many other users that have bought the product (revealed preferences). In this paper, we compare the causal effects on demand from these two signals based on data from the biggest marketplace for Android apps, Google play. This data consists of daily information, for 42 consecutive days, of more than 500,000 apps from the US version of Google play. Our main result is that consumers are much more responsive to other consumers’ revealed preferences, compared to others’ stated preferences. A 10 percentile increase in displayed average rating only increases downloads by about 3%, while a 10 percentile increase in displayed number of downloads increases downloads by about 25%.

Participants were asked to justify either a perpetrator's or a bystander's behavior on-line. Based on Perren, Gutzwiller-Helfenfinger, Malti, &amp; Hymel's model (2012), participants' justifications were coded according to 7 categories (i.e., reciprocity, moral rules, empathy, egocentric reasoning, deviant rules, lack of empathy and no moral stance) that were divided into 3 types of justifications (i.e., morally responsible, morally disengaged, and morally indifferent). Participants also completed a self-report measure on the frequency of their own experiences with cyber-aggression. Findings show that youth tend to use more morally responsible justifications when evaluating a perpetrator's behavior and morally disengaged justifications when judging a bystander's behavior.

The way a study is contextualized modulates prognostic expectations. Aims: The aim of the study was to test the effect of differing information regarding the rationale given to participants for a study on depression symptoms. Method: Sixty-nine participants with depression symptoms participated in an online study with two conditions. In random order, half were invited to participate in a treatment study and half in a cognition study. After completing the baseline assessment, participants received one of two self-help manuals. Post-assessment was conducted six weeks later. Results: Only about 64% of the participants were reached for post-assessment, and adherence was low. However, our results offer the first evidence that stronger improvements emerged in participants who were told the trial was a treatment study compared with a cognition study. Conclusion: Information given about the rationale for a study could influence symptom reduction in online treatments for patients with MDD.

This study considered the moderating role of students' social statuses in the classroom. The study sample included 435 students (48.7% females) taken from 18 Italian middle-school classrooms (i.e., sixth to eighth grade). A multigroup path analysis approach was employed to examine whether the effects of the student-teacher relationships on bullying-related behaviors differed among social statuses. The results showed that perceived conflict with the teacher was shown to have a significant positive effect on students' engagement in active bullying for students from all the statuses, except for neglected students. In particular, this effect was more relevant for rejected students. The results showed that social status and student-teacher relationships integrate and shed light on which roles are taken by young adolescents in school bullying, highlighting that it is important for the teachers to recognize these students.

For the purposes of this paper, the following measurement instruments were used: the General Data Questionnaire, the adapted Participant Role Questionnaire (PRQ) and Social Self-Efficacy scale. Chi-squared testing and logistic regression showed that boys were more often bullies and active and passive assistants, while girls were more often defenders. Both girls and boys were equally victims and bystanders of peer violence. Seventh-grade students were more often bullies and active assistants. Children who acted as defenders had higher social self-efficacy, while bystanders had lower social self-efficacy.

"1012","Participant roles in bullying: What data from Indian classes can tell us about the phenomenon","This chapter explores the idea that bullying phenomena may appear similar on the surface, but that peer reactions might differ depending on the cultural framework they are embedded in. Thus one assumes variance in social norms that translate values into behavior. If one postulates that cultural differences between India and Germany impact the bullying process, one needs to verify these cultural differences within some sociological or psychological framework. Two questions seem appropriate to gain inspiration about bullying by an intercultural comparison: why can/should we learn from Indian data, and what can/should we learn from Indian data? The chapter explores the Indian data with reference to external (e.g., hierarchy, rules) and internal (values) motivations that frame the background for social norms to work in groups.

"1013","Toward ontology of designer-user interaction in the design process: A knowledge management foundation","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore an ontology of designer-user interaction with a knowledge management foundation. To address this research gap, the authors ask the following research question: what types of knowledge on designer-user interactions are associated with design function and approach in creating effective design outcomes in a collaborative design process? Design/methodology/approach: Based on ontology of a knowledge management foundation and 99 design projects, the authors conceptualized the ontology of designer-user interaction, which considers design role, function, approach and outcome as a knowledge of designer-user interaction in the design process. Findings: Based on this analysis, the authors theorize an ontology of designer-user interactions with five dimensions: participant, role, function, design approach and design outcome. Also, this study presents a case study of how this ontology could be applied into the actual projects. Originality/value: In this study, the authors explore an ontology of designer-user interaction with a knowledge management foundation, because previous interdisciplinary design studies have not formalized the types of designer-user interaction. To address this research gap, the authors ask the following research question: What types of knowledge on designer-user interactions are associated with design function and approach in creating effective design outcomes in a collaborative design process?

"1014","Administrator and teacher attitudes toward inclusion","This study was designed to examine the attitudes of teachers and administrators toward inclusion in the classroom. Specifically this study analyzed grade level, years of teaching experience, and levels of education to examine the manner in which these factors relate to attitudes of teachers and administrators toward inclusion. Participants in this study were located in 3 school districts in East Tennessee. All data were collected through an online survey distributed to prek-12 teachers by way of email from school principals. The analysis of data was based on the responses of 183 teachers and administrators from these 3 school districts. Findings indicated that education level did not play a significant role in the attitudes, training, or resources dimensions of the study. However, participant role and years of experience did play a significant role in the participants' attitudes toward inclusion. Administrators held more positive attitudes toward inclusion than teachers and reported having more resources on inclusion than teachers. Those participants with 0-15 years of experience held more positive attitudes on inclusion than those with 16-30 plus years of experience.

"1015","Factors influencing bystanders' behavioral reactions in cyberbullying situations","The purpose of this study was to investigate the experiential, psychological, and situational factors influencing behavioral reactions of bystanders witnessing cyberbullying. It also investigated whether the ‘bystander effect’ is valid in cyberbullying situations. In addition, a moderation effect of the presence of other bystanders was examined between various influencing factors and bystander's defending tendency. A total of 1058 middle and high school students in metropolitan areas participated in the study, and the experiences of 331 students who have witnessed cyberbullying were analyzed. First, four types of bystanders were found: outsiders were the majority (n = 201, 60.7%), followed by defenders (n = 101, 30.5%), reinforcers (n = 18, 5.4%), and assistants (n = 11, 3.3%). Second, bystanders demonstrated more defending behaviors in the absence of other bystanders, thereby validating the ‘bystander effect’ in cyberbullying situations. Third, low moral disengagement, low anti-social conformity, high perceived control of the situation and bad relationship with bullies were identified as significant predictors of a bystander's defending tendency. Finally, the presence of other bystanders moderated the effect between moral disengagement and the bystander's defending tendency in relation to bullies. The implications of these results for the effective prevention and intervention of cyberbullying are discussed.

"1016","Exploring teacher assessment literacy through the process of training teachers to write assessment items","The purpose of this study was to examine the process and impact of assessment training content and delivery mode on the quality of assessment items developed by the teachers in a two-year assessment development project. Teacher characteristics were examined as potential moderating factors. Four types of delivery mode were employed in the project: synchronous online, asynchronous online, in-person workshop, and blended (a combination of online and in-person training). The quality of assessment items developed by participating teachers was measured via: 1) item acceptance rate, 2) number of item reviews (as an indicator of how many times accepted items were rejected before being approved), and 3) psychometric properties of the items (item difficulty and item discrimination) in the field test data. A teacher perception survey with quantitative and qualitative data was used to explore teacher perception of the training across the four modes and the anticipated impact of the project participation the teachers expected on their classroom assessment practices. Multilevel modeling and multiple regression were used to examine the quality of items developed by participants, while constant comparative analysis, a chi-square test, and ANOVA were employed to analyze participants' responses to a participation survey. No pre-existing teacher variables were found to have a significant impact on the item discrimination values, though prior assessment development experience beyond that of the classroom level was found to have a significant relationship with the number of reviews per item. After controlling for prior assessment development experience, participant role was found to have a significant ( p &lt; .01) impact on the number of reviews per item. Items written by participants who served as both item writers and reviewers had a significantly lower number of reviews per item, meaning their items were rejected less frequently than items written by participants who served as item writers only. No differences in item quality were found based on the mode of training in which item writers participated. Responses to the training evaluation survey differed significantly by mode of training at p &lt; .001. The in-person trained group had the lowest total rating, followed by the online asynchronous group, while the online synchronous group had the highest overall rating of the training. Participant responses to open-ended questions also differed significantly by mode of training.

"1017","Beyond study participants: A framework for engaging patients in the selection or development of clinical outcome assessments for evaluating the benefits of treatment in medical product development","Background: Patients are participating more actively in health care decision-making with regard to their health, as well as in the broader realm of assessing the value of medical products and influencing decisions about their registration and reimbursement. There is an increasing trend to include patients’ perspectives throughout the stages of medical product development by broadening the traditional study-participant role to that of an active partner throughout the process. Including patients in the selection and development of clinical outcome assessments (COAs) to evaluate the benefit of treatment is particularly important. Still, despite widespread enthusiasm, there is substantial uncertainty regarding how and when to engage patients in this process. Purpose: This manuscript proposes a methodological framework for engaging patients at varying levels in the selection and development of COAs for medical product development. Framework: The framework builds on the Food and Drug Administration’s roadmap for patient-focused COA. Methods for engaging patients across each stage in this roadmap are summarized by levels of engagement. Opportunities and examples of patient engagement (PE) in the selection and/or development of COAs are summarized, together with best practices and practical considerations. Conclusion: This paper offers a framework for understanding, planning, and implementing methods to advance PE in the selection and/or development of COAs for evaluating the benefit of medical products. The intent is to further this important discussion and enhance the process and outcome of PE in this context.

"1018","Defending victims: What does it take to intervene in bullying and how is it rewarded by peers?","Defending is considered important in reducing bullying and victimization in schools. Yet, the prevalence of defending is quite low and there is little insight into aspects that explain why students intervene in bullying situations. The current study used a longitudinal design to simultaneously examine the antecedents and status outcomes of defending behavior. It was expected that affective and social-cognitive factors explain involvement in defending. Moreover, it was proposed that defending would be rewarded with popularity among peers, but only for defenders who were not victimized themselves. Unconflated multilevel path models were used and data came from students in grades 4–6 of Finnish elementary schools ( N = 4209 students from 210 classrooms and 38 schools; M age 11.25; 50% boys). Affective empathy and students' self-efficacy beliefs were predictive of defending behavior over time, whereas cognitive empathy was not. Additionally, defenders increased their popularity among their peers. No substantial differences between victims and non-victims were found. This pattern of results suggests that, irrespective of victim status, specific children are more likely to defend in bullying situations and are rewarded with increased popularity.

"1019","Are reading difficulties associated with bullying involvement?","Reading difficulties (RDs) are easily noticed by classmates, may cause frustration in the affected students, and are often accompanied by emotional, behavioral, and interpersonal problems at school. Although interviews with students with RDs have revealed bullying experiences, whether RDs actually increase the risk of bullying involvement has not been investigated before. We tested the association of self-reported RDs with peer-reported involvement in bullying in a nationally representative sample of 17,188 students (grades 3–8) from 1045 classrooms in 147 schools. Results indicated that experienced difficulties in the most fundamental learning skill seem to put students at risk especially for victimization at school (viewed by peers as victims and bully/victims), when gender, level of schooling, self-esteem, and difficulties in math were taken into account. In general, over a third of students with RDs were involved in bullying as victims, bullies, or bully/victims, compared with approximately a fifth of students without RDs.

"1020","Parental self-efficacy and bullying in elementary school","This study investigated associations of general and specific parental self-efficacy factors with bullying and peer victimization behaviors among 142 fourth and fifth graders and their parents. Using structural equation modeling, exploratory factor analysis was used to examine one general parenting self-efficacy measure and a bullying-specific parent self-efficacy measure. The latter produced two unique factors: (a) self-efficacy to know when one’s child is bullied, and (b) self-efficacy to respond to one’s child being bullied. Child reports of bullying and peer victimization were simultaneously regressed on the three (i.e., one general and two specific) parent self-efficacy factors. Findings revealed that parental self-efficacy to know when one’s child is bullied was uniquely and negatively associated with both bullying and victimization. Additionally, and contrary to expectations, parental self-efficacy to respond when one’s child is being bullied was uniquely and positively associated with victimization.

"1021","Expectancy of impairment attenuates marijuana-induced risk taking","Background: Marijuana use has been associated with increased risk-taking and impulsive behavior. While pharmacologic effects of marijuana can lead to inhibitory impairment, expectancy of potential impairment may result in compensatory behavioral response by decreasing impulsive decisions and risky behaviors. With the increases in marijuana use and related problems, a better understanding of the individual characteristics associated with marijuana intoxication and risky behavior is needed. This study examined the role of impairment expectancies in marijuana's acute effects on behavioral measures of impulsivity and risk-taking. Methods: Participants (N=136) were regular marijuana users. A balanced placebo design (BPD) was used crossing marijuana administration (i.e., 0% Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) vs. 2.8% THC) with stimulus expectancy (i.e., Told Placebo vs. Told THC). Marijuana outcome expectancies were measured by self-report and dependent measures included a number of behavioral impulsivity tasks and the balloon analogue risk task (BART). Results: Among participants who received THC, higher expectancies for cognitive-behavioral impairment (CBI) were related to lower risk-taking on the BART. Among those who received placebo, there was no association between CBI expectancies and BART performance. CBI expectancies did not moderate the stimulus expectancy effect on the BART nor drug or stimulus expectancy effects on impulsivity measures. Conclusions: Results provide initial evidence that expectancies of greater impairment are associated with compensatory behavior on a risk-taking task under acute marijuana intoxication. Future studies should examine the role of impairment expectancies on risk behaviors of substantial public health concern, such as driving while under the influence of marijuana.

The Overt and Relational Aggression Participant Role Behavior Scales were designed to measure aggression, assisting, reinforcing, defending, victimization, and outsider behavior during acts of peer aggression in an ethnically diverse sample of 609 adolescents ( M age = 12 years). The data fit the hypothesized 12-factor model, and measurement invariance was established across gender. Relational victimization, but not overt victimization, was positively associated with all other relational aggression roles. Each participant role subscale was positively associated with depressive symptoms with the exception of the overt and relational outsider subscales. Future research and intervention efforts should consider overt and relational aggression participant roles, separately.

"1023","An examination of differences in moral disengagement and empathy among bullying participant groups","This study examines how different roles in school bullying (e.g., bullies, victims, defenders) vary in cognitive and affective empathy and moral disengagement. Findings from this study revealed that levels of empathy and moral disengagement differed significantly among bullying groups for 702 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students in the United States. An analysis of variance showed differential patterns between bullying groups and outcome variables (i.e., cognitive and affective empathy and moral disengagement). In addition, the correlation between moral disengagement and empathy was statistically significant and negative. Affective empathy and cognitive empathy both significantly predicted moral disengagement; with every one unit increase in moral disengagement, affective empathy decreased by .38 and cognitive empathy decreased by .39. Students who scored higher in moral disengagement tended to score lower in empathy. The current findings confirm and extend the literature on the relation between moral disengagement, empathy, prosociality, and victimising behaviour. This information can inform school-wide and targeted intervention efforts.

"1024","Adolescents’ explicit and implicit evaluations of hypothetical and actual peers with different bullying participant roles","This study examined how adolescents evaluate bullying at three levels of specificity: (a) the general concept of bullying, (b) hypothetical peers in different bullying participant roles, and (c) actual peers in different bullying participant roles. Participants were 163 predominantly ethnic majority adolescents in The Netherlands (58% girls; M age = 16.34 years, SD = 0.79). For the hypothetical peers, we examined adolescents’ explicit evaluations as well as their implicit evaluations. Adolescents evaluated the general concept of bullying negatively. Adolescents’ explicit evaluations of hypothetical and actual peers in the bullying roles depended on their own role, but adolescents’ implicit evaluations of hypothetical peers did not. Adolescents’ explicit evaluations of hypothetical peers and actual peers were different. Hypothetical bullies were evaluated negatively by all classmates, whereas hypothetical victims were evaluated relatively positively compared with the other roles. However, when adolescents evaluated their actual classmates, the differences between bullies and the other roles were smaller, whereas victims were evaluated the most negatively of all roles. Further research should take into account that adolescents’ evaluations of hypothetical peers differ from their evaluations of actual peers.

While the bystander effect was not found to be valid in bullying situations, there were significant differences in factors influencing a bystander’s defending behavior in terms of the presence of other bystanders. In cases where bullying was witnessed in the presence of other bystanders, factors such as one’s previous experience as a perpetrator, anti-social behavior, level of harm, relationship to the victim and popularity had an effect on the defending behavior of bystanders. On the other hand, in the absence of other bystanders, one’s previous experience as a victim, level of empathy, and perceived control had an effect on the defending behavior of bystanders. The implications of these results for an effective intervention for school bullying in terms of bystanders are discussed.

A total of 707 primary and secondary school students ( M = 14.7) in Taiwan participated in this study. Two Olweus-like global items were used to identify students’ participant roles. A self-reported cyberbullying severity scale (CSS) was developed and validated by Rasch measurement. Results of this study supported the reliability and validity of the 16-item CSS. Impersonation was rated as the most serious type of cyberbullying. Cyberbullying behaviours that occurred in private were rated as less severe than were those that occurred in public. A Rasch latent regression analysis revealed that some gender and involvement effects were found, but no statistically significant difference was found among means of four participant roles. The behavioural hierarchy of cyberbullying severity, mean differences among personal attributions and cyberbullying intervention are discussed at the end of the article.

"1027","Eye movement during recall reduces objective memory performance: An extended replication","Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder involves making eye movements (EMs) during recall of a traumatic image. Experimental studies have shown that the dual task decreases self-reported memory vividness and emotionality. However valuable, these data are prone to demand effects and little can be inferred about the mechanism(s) underlying the observed effects. The current research aimed to fill this lacuna by providing two objective tests of memory performance. Experiment I involved a stimulus discrimination task. Findings were that EM during stimulus recall not only reduces self-reported memory vividness, but also slows down reaction time in a task that requires participants to discriminate the stimulus from perceptually similar stimuli. Experiment II involved a fear conditioning paradigm. It was shown that EM during recall of a threatening stimulus intensifies fearful responding to a perceptually similar yet non-threat-related stimulus, as evidenced by increases in danger expectancies and skin conductance responses. The latter result was not corroborated by startle EMG data. Together, the findings suggest that the EM manipulation renders stimulus attributes less accessible for future recall.

"1028","The influences of parent and peer attachment on bullying","Individuals with secure attachments to parents and peers are less likely to be bullies and victims of bullying. The current study examined the interplay between gender, parent attachment, and peer attachment as factors related to roles (bullying involvement, defending a victim, and outsider) during bullying. One-hundred forty-eight adolescents ( M age = 15.68) completed surveys about parent and peer attachment and roles during bullying. Findings indicated that females were less likely than males to be involved in bullying and were more likely than males to defend a victim or be an outsider ( p s &lt; .05). Greater attachment security to parents and peers was associated with less involvement in bullying and greater defending of victims ( p s &lt; .05). Additionally, a significant three-way interaction demonstrated that greater peer attachment security predicted less bullying involvement for those with lower parent attachment security ( p &lt; .05), but not for those with higher parent attachment security ( p &gt; .05). However, this was only true for males ( p &lt; .01). These results indicate that having a secure attachment to peers may be a potential protective factor against bullying involvement for males with insecure attachments to parents. Future research should examine the possible mechanisms involved in the association between attachment and bullying, such as empathy, aggression, or social information processing.

"1029","Marijuana stereotypes and the “jay-dar”: Perceptions of cannabis use and memory abilities based upon appearance","With increasing legalization of cannabis, global use has risen. While individuals may choose not to disclose cannabis use, if others can accurately guess based upon appearance there may be negative implications given common stereotypes about cannabis effects on cognition, particularly memory. This study examined (1) the ability of individuals to discriminate between cannabis users and non-users based upon appearance and (2) the relationship between ratings of Perceived Memory Performance and actual or perceived cannabis use. In Study 1, undergraduates ( N = 244) rated photographs on the likelihood that the individuals use cannabis. As hypothesized, photographs of users received higher ratings than non-users. In Study 2, a separate group of undergraduates ( N = 218) rated the photos as to how well they thought each individual would perform on a learning and memory test. While actual user status was unrelated to Perceived Memory Performance, perceived user status negatively related to Perceived Memory Performance. Results suggest cannabis users are rated as more likely to be users than non-users, based upon appearance. Further, results suggest a stereotype of memory deficits against individuals who “look like” cannabis users. These findings have important implications for potential stigma, as well as for research on cannabis use effects.

Greater popularity prioritization was also associated with more bullying among boys with high levels, and girls with low levels, of popularity. In addition, popularity was positively related to defending among girls, but not boys. Lower popularity prioritization also contributed to greater defending overall.

In the final wave, most decisions can be accounted for by assuming pure selfishness. Stable behavior in the sense that subjects stick to their decisions over time is observed predominantly for purely selfish subjects.

"1033","Moral reasoning about school bullying in involved adolescents","The aim of the present study was to investigate how bullying incident participant roles and moral reasoning relate to each other in adolescents. To do so, we examined sociomoral judgments about hypothetical bullying incidents and moral disengagement in adolescents identified as bullies, defenders of the victim and passive bystanders. Six-hundred and twenty-six high school students (13- to 15-years-old) took part in this study and 131 were assigned a specific bullying incident participant role through peer nomination. Findings reveal that defenders of the victim show greater and more uniform moral sensibility than did both bullies and passive bystanders. Sociomoral reasoning helped differentiate between both bully subtypes (bully-leaders and bully-followers) and passive bystander beyond displaying greater moral disengagement than defenders did.

"1034","Consumer Directed Care in Australia: Early perceptions and experiences of staff, clients and carers","The study aimed to identify the shared issues and challenges being experienced by staff, their clients and informal carers, with the introduction of Consumer Directed Care (CDC). Secondary analysis was undertaken of data that had been initially collected, via semi-structured in-depth interviews, to inform the development of a discrete choice experiment. The raw staff and client/carer data were re-examined using an iterative inductive process. The analysis focused on locating the shared themes and differences between the participant groups based on their CDC experience. The data were also assessed for difficulties or barriers that impacted on the service. Four broad shared themes were derived: culture, role change, operational systems and resourcing, but with a range of diverse and sometimes conflicting sub-themes between the different participant groups. Differences can be linked to participant role in the service chain, with discordance emerging between what has been traditionally offered and what might be possible. This investigation occurred during the period in which services were transitioning from a traditional aged care service model to a new model of service provision requiring considerable industry change. We conclude that existing industry regulation, culture and practice supports an established service model in Australia that arguably makes translation of the objectives of CDC difficult.

In EXP 1, participants (22) were run in a counterbalanced repeated measures study in both simply knowledgeable (SK) and knowledgeable with suppression (SP) conditions. A P300-based, concealed information test (“Complex Trial Protocol”; CTP) with a 50/50 Target/Nontarget (T/NT) ratio was given both with and without instructions to suppress semantic memories. The results showed increased P300s to probe name stimuli, reduced (but still high positive) aIAT d-scores, and increased simple reaction times to all stimuli used in ERP tests in the SP condition. EXP 2 was similar, but with SP and SK in two separate groups, and a 20/80 T/NT ratio. Again, ERP and aIAT results failed to show a suppression effect for semantic memory. The behavioral data suggest some task demand effects under suppression instructions, and that EXP 1 was more demanding than EXP 2.

"1036","Do meta-cognitive beliefs affect meta-awareness of intrusive thoughts about trauma?","Background and Objectives: People exposed to trauma often experience intrusive thoughts and memories about that event. Research examining people's responses to trauma assumes that people can accurately notice the occurrence of symptoms. However, we know from the broader cognitive literature on mind-wandering that people are not always aware of their current focus of attention. That lack of awareness has implications for our theoretical and practical understanding of how trauma survivors recover from their experience. In the current study we investigated whether people's meta-cognitive beliefs about controlling trauma-related intrusions influenced the occurrence and meta-awareness of those intrusions. Methods: We recruited participants who scored high (strong beliefs) or low (weak beliefs) on beliefs regarding the importance of controlling intrusive thoughts. Participants viewed a trauma film then—during a subsequent reading task—reported any film-related intrusions they noticed. We also intermittently asked half the participants to report what they were thinking at that particular moment, to “catch” intrusions without meta-awareness. Results: People are not always aware of their trauma intrusions, and importantly, people with strong beliefs are more likely to notice trauma related intrusions both with and without meta-awareness than people with weak beliefs. Limitations: We used an analogue trauma, and focused on a particular metacognitive belief, both of which somewhat limit generalizability. We also cannot definitively rule out demand effects. Conclusions: Our data add to existing research showing people may lack meta-awareness of trauma—related thoughts, and suggest that survivors with particular metacognitive characteristics may be more vulnerable to ‘mind-wandering’ about trauma without awareness.

"1037","Duration adaptation modulates EEG correlates of subsequent temporal encoding","Repetitive exposure to relatively long or short sensory events has been shown to shorten or lengthen the perceived duration of a subsequent event. However, the neural basis of this phenomenon, called duration adaptation, remains unclear. In this study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate whether duration adaptation could modulate the subsequent temporal encoding represented by the contingent negative variation (CNV). Participants were asked to reproduce the duration of a test stimulus after adapting duration (Experiment 1) or after anchor duration (Experiment 2). We found that both adapting duration and anchor duration affected the reproduction duration of a subsequently presented test stimulus. The simultaneously recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed that test stimuli evoked clearly identifiable N1, P2 and CNV components in the fronto-central scalp. Further analyses showed that the CNV amplitude was modulated by duration adaptation: adaptation to shorter duration (200 ms) increased whereas adaptation to longer duration (800 ms) decreased the CNV amplitude. These findings suggest that the neural correlates of temporal encoding represented by the CNV amplitude reflect the duration aftereffect. Additionally, the duration adaptation effect observed on the P2 component also suggests an early expectancy effect on subsequent encoding processes. Finally, no effect of anchor duration was observed on the CNV amplitude, which implies that different mechanisms underlie the duration aftereffect and the anchor effect.

"1038","Determining cannabis use status from a photograph: An assessment of the “jay-dar” in neuropsychologists","Background: Few studies examining the cognitive effects of chronic cannabis use utilize research designs where examiners are blind to user status. Even in those that do, researchers may be able to guess the user status of participants, leaving these studies vulnerable to the expectancy effect confound. Objectives: The present study examined the ability of neuropsychologists (those who would conduct research on the cognitive effects of cannabis) to differentiate cannabis users and nonusers based on physical appearance from photographs. Method: We recruited 84 participants from an international neuropsychology listserv. The sample was 59.5% female and 95.2% Caucasian, with a mean age of 41.39 years (range 26–65). Each neuropsychologist rated 25 target faces (12 cannabis users, 13 nonusers) on a Marijuana Use Likelihood Index based upon individuals' photographs. Results: Results indicate a main effect of user group, as neuropsychologists ascribed higher ratings to cannabis users on the Marijuana Use Likelihood Index, suggesting they perceive them as more likely to be users, relative to nonusers. Results also demonstrated a main effect of gender, as males received higher user ratings than females, and a significant main effect of rater gender, as female raters were more likely to rate individuals as cannabis users relative to male raters. Conclusions/Importance: The results demonstrate the importance of assessing researchers' expectations when studying the effects of chronic cannabis use, as even those designs that keep examiners blind to participant user status may be vulnerable to expectancy effects if examiners are able to guess user status based upon appearance alone.

The following roles were identified via peer nomination in a sample of 5,083 sixth- and ninth-graders: pro-bullying role, victim, defender, outsider, and bully-victim. One of these roles could be assigned to about 55% of the pupils. The proportion of pupils in a pro-bullying role, but not the proportion of victims, is smaller in Grade 9 than in Grade 6. Defenders are less frequent in Grade 9 as well. The majority of pupils in a pro-bullying role are boys, whereas most defenders are girls. Furthermore, pupils in a probullying role are distinguished by their controversial status and weak academic achievement. Victims have a low sociometric status and average marks. Defenders prove to be very popular and high performing.

"1040","Bullying and theory of mind: A review","Although aggressive behaviours, and especially bullying, are regarded as socially undesirable, there is controversy as to whether they are also evidence of deficits on measures of social skills or social competence. Many measures of emotional intelligence and social competence include aspects of social desirability. However, theory of mind skills are neutral as regards social desirability and can be used for prosocial or antisocial ends. It has been proposed that children who bully others at school, especially ringleader bullies, may actually have and use good theory of mind skills. Nine studies were found that directly examined theory of mind in relation to roles involved in bullying in childhood. Of these, five found some positive association of theory of mind with bullying behaviors. In addition, some associations were found with defending behaviors, and negative associations with being a victim of bullying. These associations have been found to interact, in one or more studies, with type of bully, type of aggression, age, gender, and individual characteristics such as levels of narcissism and levels of victimization experience. Although the research base is limited, the evidence does support the view that theory of mind skills can be used for both prosocial ( e.g. defending) and antisocial ( e.g. bullying) ends, whereas it is the victims of bullying who may be more likely to be deficient in such skills.

"1041","The interpersonal paradigm and the degree of the therapist's involvement (1983)","I became progressively aware of an important distinction between two cleavages in psychoanalytic thought which had been more or less fused in my mind. I refer to the distinction between two major cleavages in psychoanalytic thought: one cleavage is between the interpersonal paradigm and the drive discharge paradigm. The other cleavage is between those who believe the analyst inevitably participates in a major way in the analytic situation and those who do not. My goals in this paper are much more modest than the comparison of the paradigms. I wish to demonstrate first that the cleavages are indeed not parallel in our literature, that is, that an adherent of the interpersonal paradigm need not ascribe a major participant role to the analyst and that an adherent of the drive discharge pattern may ascribe a major participant role to the analyst. Then I will outline some of the implications for technique which I believe follow if one accepts the interpersonal paradigm.

"1042","Examining self-efficacy as a mediator on the relation between bullying role behaviors and academic success in early adolescence","The purpose of this project was to explore the mediating effects of social and academic self-efficacy on the relations between bullying role behaviors and academic achievement. Research has primarily focused on the bully and the victim in bullying situations, which neglects to examine the experiences of those who witness or are involved in the aggressive act, including assisting bullies, defending victims, and ignoring others. As a result, research has overlooked how other bullying roles relate to academic performance. However, research has explored how various bullying role behaviors relate to self-efficacy. Additionally, self-efficacy has been associated with academic performance, such as GPA. The purpose of the current study was to add to the existing bullying role behavior literature by investigating the relations among bully participant role behaviors, self-efficacy beliefs, and GPA. This project investigated the mediational effect of social and academic self-efficacy on the relation between bullying role behaviors and GPA. The mediation models were evaluated separately by gender to differentiate this effect in males and females. In other words, does social and academic self-efficacy explain the association between bully participant role behaviors and GPA in males and females? Data were collected on 7th-grade students (N= 348). In general, most models exploring the association between bullying role behaviors and GPA through social and academic self-efficacy had consistent results in the male and female samples; however, there were some significant results that were supported in females only (victimization experience). When exploring the mediation models, individuals who engaged in bullying, assisting, outsider behaviors or experience victimization had negative associations with social self-efficacy and academic self-efficacy; there were no significant positive associations between defending behavior and self-efficacy. Across all models, social and academic self-efficacy were significantly and positively associated. Additionally, all or most of the models found significant positive associations between academic self-efficacy and GPA and significant and negative associations between social self-efficacy and GPA. The results of the mediational model varied for each bullying role behavior to suggest that an individual's behavior when bullying occurs influences their self-perceptions and GPA differentially.

"1043","The role of self-transcendence and cognitive processes in the response expectancy effect","Neuropsychological assessment is known to be influenced by expectancy effects, which can either enhance (placebo) or diminish (nocebo) cognitive performance. Research suggests that the response expectancy effect is influenced by various individual and situational factors and that the placebo effect results in an increase in monitoring processes as measured indirectly. However, the impact on monitoring processes has not yet been studied by direct measures such as Judgement Of Learning (JOL). This study aimed to investigate the response expectancy effect on various neuropsychological tasks, including a task that directly assesses monitoring capacities (JOL). In addition to determining which cognitive functions are influenced by the expectancy effect, this study examined the moderating role of the self-transcendence dimension of personality. Eighty healthy subjects were exposed to three bogus conditions presented as allegedly having a positive, negative, or no impact on cognitive capacities. Then they completed, in random order, three blocks of tasks (executive, attentional, and memory), one in each condition. Results showed an effect of negative instructions on flexibility (poorer performance) and memory (better performance) scores. Furthermore, positive instructions led to better explicit monitoring capacities (JOL) than the neutral condition. These effects were moderated by self-transcendence, as only participants with moderate or high self-transcendence exhibited these effects. Overall, our results showed that the response expectancy effect emerges from a combination of individual and cognitive factors.

"1044","Justice and care: Decision making of medical school student promotions committees","Accreditation standards for allopathic medical schools in the United States require that each institution have in place a mechanism by which student progress through the curriculum is monitored. These entities, referred to here as promotions committees, make important decisions in a high stakes medical education environment. Yet little is currently known about how promotions committee members make decisions about students who experience academic failures and lapses in professional behavior. Using the work of Lawrence Kohlberg and Carol Gilligan on moral development as a theoretical basis, the purpose of this study was to elucidate committee members' perceptions of the role of promotions committees, the ethical orientations that guide individual decision making, and the influence of particular student characteristics and circumstances on that decision making process. An electronic survey was sent to representatives at 143 accredited allopathic medical schools in the United States with a request to distribute the survey to all voting members of that institution's promotions committee. Survey questions were primarily quantitative in nature. A total of 241 surveys were completed by individuals at 55 medical schools. Data were examined by gender, age, participant role (medical student, faculty member, administrator), and years of committee experience. Major findings included the concurrent orientations of both justice and care in individual decision making, with some prioritization of responsiveness to particular student characteristics and circumstances over consistency across student cases. Significant differences by age, role and gender were identified, but these were limited in number. The aspects of student cases that were most influential to committee member decision making concerned student characteristics and circumstances that could reasonably be considered as being within the students' control, in particular lapses in professional behavior. Recommendations for future research and promotions committee member training were discussed.

"1045","Why the dynamics of competition matter for category profitability","Category management (CM) has become a widespread trade practice in recent years. A category manager's decision problem is complex and multifaceted owing to demand dependencies across products and across time. Extant research on CM has typically focused on one or the other of these dependencies, but seldom both. The authors address this research gap by presenting a competition framework that reconciles cross-sectional breadth (large numbers of stockkeeping units in any given period) with longitudinal depth (demand effects across time). The endeavor is to offer retailers a general, realistic, and practical CM approach by comprehensively accounting for competitive effects. The authors demonstrate their approach using real-world data in the beer category for a midsize grocery chain in the northeastern United States. After determining the optimal weekly prices for the entire assortment over 23 weeks, the authors report a profit yield that is 3.30% more than in the benchmark logit model and substantially more than in the retailer's current everyday low price policy.

"1046","More than metaphor: Conceptualization and measurement of social setting characteristics","Identifying and measuring setting-level phenomena has been a challenge for community psychology throughout its history (Shinn, 1990; Tseng &amp; Seidman, 2007). Though initially defined as concerning person-setting interaction (Bennett et al., 1966), community psychology has made slow progress in improving setting-level measurement. Despite longstanding warnings from community psychologists and others about the problems of substituting individual perceptions for measures of setting-level characteristics (Shinn, 1990; Shinn &amp; Rapkin, 2000; Trickett &amp; Wilkinson, 1979; Tseng &amp; Seidman, 2007), community researchers rarely attempt to measure setting-level characteristics. Substituting individual perceptions for setting-level measures may be unavoidable and understandable. The absence of an organic center in social settings (Tillich, 1954) confers a distinct advantage to individual-level measurement strategies. To get at setting-level characteristics, one must often ask for individual opinions or perceptions and build setting-level measures from there. This is particularly true if the social settings under consideration are not formal organizations where policies, bylaws, and other setting-level features can be directly examined. The purpose of this chapter is to review approaches to conceptualization and measurement of setting-level characteristics, elucidate the importance of and barriers to setting-level measurement, and propose a typology and steps in constructing setting-level measures.

"1047","Are effects of action on perception real? Evidence from transformed movements","It has been argued that several reported non-visual influences on perception cannot be truly perceptual. If they were, they should affect the perception of target objects and reference objects used to express perceptual judgments, and thus cancel each other out. This reasoning presumes that non-visual manipulations impact target objects and comparison objects equally. In the present study we show that equalizing a body-related manipulation between target objects and reference objects essentially abolishes the impact of that manipulation so as it should do when that manipulation actually altered perception. Moreover, the manipulation has an impact on judgements when applied to only the target object but not to the reference object, and that impact reverses when only applied to the reference object but not to the target object. A perceptual explanation predicts this reversal, whereas explanations in terms of post-perceptual response biases or demand effects do not. Altogether these results suggest that body-related influences on perception cannot as a whole be attributed to extraperceptual factors.

"1048","Associations between the group processes of bullying and adolescent substance use","The adverse impact of bullying and victimization on substance use among youth has received increasing attention. Bullying is a specific type of aggressive behavior that not only involves bullies and victims but also followers, who actively support or reinforce the bully; defenders, who intervene to defend or assist the victim; or outsiders who passively observe or ignore the bullying. Limited research to date has linked these five bullying role behaviors to substance use. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between each of the bullying role behaviors and adolescent alcohol and tobacco use. Participants were 1255 (748 female) students ( M age = 15.3, age range: 13–17 years) in Grades 9 (n = 714) and 11 (n = 541). Bullying role behaviors, alcohol and tobacco onset and intensity, and alcohol-related harms were assessed. Results revealed an association between pro-bullying behavior (bullying and following) and all substance use variables, and between defender behavior and smoking and alcohol-related harm. No relationship between victimization, or outsider behavior, and substance use was found after controlling for the other bullying roles. The findings highlight the complex relationship between bullying roles, alcohol and tobacco use and alcohol-related harm in adolescents.

"1053","Empathy in adolescence: Relations with emotion awareness and social roles","In this study, we aimed at gaining a better understanding of the individual differences contributing to feelings of empathy in adolescents. Therefore, we examined the extent to which emotion awareness (e.g., recognizing and appreciating one's own and the emotions of others) and a tendency for certain social roles (e.g., helping or teasing peers when being bullied) are related to adolescents’ levels of empathy. The sample was comprised of 182 adolescents aged between 11 and 16. Empathy and emotion awareness were assessed using self-report measures. Peer reports were used to indicate adolescents’ different social roles: Bullying, defending the victim, and outsider behaviour. Outcomes demonstrated that evaluating one's own and the emotions of others, and more defending nominations were associated with both affective and cognitive empathy, whereas aspects of emotion awareness which are linked with internalizing symptoms were related to empathic distress, suggesting maladaptive emotion appraisal. Furthermore, outsider behaviour was associated with empathic distress, emphasizing a self-focused orientation. In contrast, more bullying was negatively associated with cognitive empathy. Overall, these outcomes demonstrate that, besides social roles, emotion awareness is an important factor for adaptive empathic reactions, whereas emotion dysregulation might cause distress when witnessing the negative feelings of others.

"1054","Implicit learning of between-group intervals in auditory temporal structures","Implicit learning of temporal structure has primarily been reported when events within a sequence (e.g., visual-spatial locations, tones) are systematically ordered and correlated with the temporal structure. An auditory serial reaction time task was used to investigate implicit learning of temporal intervals between pseudorandomly ordered syllables. Over exposure, participants identified syllables presented in sequences with weakly metrical temporal structures. In a test block, the temporal structure differed from exposure only in the duration of the interonset intervals (IOIs) between groups. It was hypothesized that reaction time (RT) to syllables following between-group IOIs would decrease with exposure and increase at test. In Experiments 1 and 2, the sequences presented over exposure and test were counterbalanced across participants (Pattern 1 and Pattern 2 conditions). An RT increase at test to syllables following between-group IOIs was only evident in the condition that presented an exposure structure with a slightly stronger meter (Pattern 1 condition). The Pattern 1 condition also elicited a global expectancy effect: Test block RT slowed to earlier-than-expected syllables (i.e., syllables shifted to an earlier beat) but not to later-than-expected syllables. Learning of between-group IOIs and the global expectancy effect extended to the Pattern 2 condition when meter was strengthened with an external pulse (Experiment 2). Experiment 3 further demonstrated implicit learning of a new weakly metrical structure with only earlier-than-expected violations at test. Overall findings demonstrate learning of weakly metrical rhythms without correlated event structures (i.e., sequential syllable orders). They further suggest the presence of a global expectancy effect mediated by metrical strength.

"1055","Associations among middle school students' bullying roles and social skills","This study explored the relations among self-reported bully participant role behaviors (i.e., bullying, assisting, experiencing victimization, defending, and outsider behavior) and self-reported social skills (i.e., cooperation, assertion, empathy, and self-control) among boys and girls. The sample consisted of 636 middle school students (52% boys, 84% White). Results indicated several significant relations between bullying participant behaviors and social skills with some gender differences in those relations as well. Most notably, defenders have higher levels of multiple social skills. Future research should seek out additional information regarding inter- and intra-personal characteristics in order to be able to better understand bullying participant role behaviors.

"1056","Psychotherapy versus pharmacotherapy of depression: What’s the evidence?","Objectives: Depression may be treated by psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or their combination. There is an ongoing debate whether one of these approaches is possibly superior. A recent meta-analysis reported results in favour of pharmacotherapy. Methods: Individual studies and meta-analyses on the comparative efficacy of psychotherapy vs. pharmacotherapy were reviewed. Results: Evidence suggests that psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are equally efficacious in the short-term, but psychotherapy is superior in the long-term. For the recently stated hypothesis that pharmacotherapy is superior to psychotherapy in studies without a pill placebo condition, which implies equally including a positive expectancy effect for both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy no evidence was found. Conclusion: Depression may be treated by psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy with equivalent results in the short-term and advantages for psychotherapy in the long-term. As the rates of response and remission are still limited in both treatments, further improvement of treatments is required.

"1057","Dynamic emotion perception and prior expectancy","Social interactions require the ability to rapidly perceive emotion from various incoming dynamic, multisensory cues. Prior expectations reduce incoming emotional information and direct attention to cues that are aligned with what is expected. Studies to date have investigated the prior expectancy effect using static emotional images, despite the fact that dynamic stimuli would represent greater ecological validity. The objective of the study was to create a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm to examine the influence of prior expectations on naturalistic emotion perception. For this purpose, we developed a dynamic emotion perception task, which consisted of audio-visual videos that carry emotional information congruent or incongruent with prior expectations. The results show that emotional congruency was associated with activity in prefrontal regions, amygdala, and putamen, whereas emotional incongruency was associated with activity in temporoparietal junction and mid-cingulate gyrus. Supported by the behavioural results, our findings suggest that prior expectations are reinforced after repeated experience and learning, whereas unexpected emotions may rely on fast change detection processes. The results from the current study are compatible with the notion that the ability to automatically detect unexpected changes in complex dynamic environments allows for adaptive behaviours in potentially advantageous or threatening situations.

"1058","Choosing to be a defender or an outsider in a school bullying incident: Determining factors and the defending process","This study examined the determinants of students’ willingness to intervene in bullying incidents, as well as the process underlying students’ defending behaviors. The participants were 24 students (12 defenders and 12 outsiders) recruited from six secondary schools in southern Taiwan. The study used semi-structured interviews to collect qualitative data and a grounded theory approach to analyse the data. The results showed that bystanders in bullying situations tended to assess the perceived severity of a bullying incident, personal responsibility, affective factors, victim characteristics, relationship with the victim, and other factors before committing to an intervention. This study found four possible phases of defending behavior: a) personal assessment affects a bystander’s decision to act as a defender or an outsider; b) a defender evaluates the severity of a situation and the relationship with the bully to determine strategies for defending; c) defenders who come forward to intervene are interrogated or threatened by bullies; and d) defenders then reassess whether to intervene again. The results of this study suggest that bystander intervention programs can encourage students’ personal responsibility, awareness of the severity of school bullying, improvement of interpersonal relationships, and self-efficacy to raise bystanders’ willingness to defend a victim.

"1059","Participant roles of bullying in adolescence: Status characteristics, social behavior, and assignment criteria","This study had three goals. First, we examined the prevalence of the participant roles of bullying in middle adolescence and possible gender differences therein. Second, we examined the behavioral and status characteristics associated with the participant roles in middle adolescence. Third, we compared two sets of criteria for assigning students to the participant roles of bullying. Participants were 1,638 adolescents (50.9% boys, M age = 16.38 years, SD = .80) who completed the shortened participant role questionnaire and peer nominations for peer status and behavioral characteristics. Adolescents were assigned to the participant roles according to the relative criteria of Salmivalli, Lagerspetz, Björkqvist, Österman, and Kaukiainen (1996). Next, the students in each role were divided in two subgroups based on an additional absolute criterion: the Relative Only Criterion subgroup (nominated by less than 10% of their classmates) and the Absolute &amp; Relative Criterion subgroup (nominated by at least 10% of their classmates). Adolescents who bullied or reinforced or assisted bullies were highly popular and disliked and scored high on peer-valued characteristics. Adolescents who were victimized held the weakest social position in the peer group. Adolescents who defended victims were liked and prosocial, but average in popularity and peer-valued characteristics. Outsiders held a socially weak position in the peer group, but were less disliked, less aggressive, and more prosocial than victims. The behavior and status profiles of adolescents in the participant roles were more extreme for the Absolute &amp; Relative Criterion subgroup than for the Relative Only Criterion subgroup.

The self-report questionnaires included the questionnaire of teachers' supporting behavior to students, gratitude questionnaire and achievement motivation scale. Results: (1) Perception of teachers' supporting behavior positively predicted academic achievement. (2) Gratitude moderated the relationship between perception of teachers' supporting behavior and academic achievement. (3) Achievement motivation mediated this moderation effect.

"1062","Old age and prosocial behavior: Social preferences or experimental confounds?","Experimental and field evidence indicate a positive link between social preferences and age, most strikingly between the elderly and young adults. However, it is possible that the seemingly positive link between age and preferences stems from confounds in experimental procedure. In a dictator game study we find that elderly participants do indeed transfer higher shares of their endowments to their peers than a standard sample of student participants. This result holds good even in treatments accounting for wealth differences and experimenter demand effects. However, we observe no difference in behavior when we compare elderly participants and students who have not previously participated in economic experiments. Accordingly, it is possible that the seemingly stronger social preferences of the elderly are due to confounds associated with lack of experience with economic experiments. In addition, when comparing incentivized and hypothetical transfer decisions, we observe a hypothetical bias in treatments with a “take” framing, but not in treatments with the standard “give” framing.

"1063","Identifying demand effects in a large network of product categories","Planning marketing mix strategies requires retailers to understand within- as well as cross-category demand effects. Most retailers carry products in a large variety of categories, leading to a high number of such demand effects to be estimated. At the same time, we do not expect cross-category effects between all categories. This paper outlines a methodology to estimate a parsimonious product category network without prior constraints on its structure. To do so, sparse estimation of the Vector AutoRegressive Market Response Model is presented. We find that cross-category effects go beyond substitutes and complements, and that categories have asymmetric roles in the product category network. Destination categories are most influential for other product categories, while convenience and occasional categories are most responsive. Routine categories are moderately influential and moderately responsive.

"1064","Do you know what I know? The impact of participant role in children's referential communication","For successful language use, interlocutors must be able to accurately assess their shared knowledge (“common ground”). Such knowledge can be accumulated through linguistic and non-linguistic context, but the same context can be associated with different patterns of knowledge, depending on the interlocutor’s participant role (Wilkes-Gibbs and Clark, 1992). Although there is substantial evidence that children’s ability to model partners’ knowledge develops gradually, most such evidence focuses on non-linguistic context. We investigated the extent to which 8- to 10-year-old children can assess common ground developed through prior linguistic context, and whether this is sensitive to variations in participant role. Children repeatedly described tangram figures to another child, and then described the same figures to a third child who had been a side-participant, an overhearer, or absent during the initial conversation. Children showed evidence of partner modeling, producing shorter referential expressions with repeated mention to the same partner. Moreover, they demonstrated sensitivity to differences in common ground with the third child based on participant role on some but not all measures (e.g., description length, but not definiteness). Our results suggest that by ten, children make distinctions about common ground accumulated through prior linguistic context but do not yet consistently deploy this knowledge in an adult-like way.

"1065","Feedback processing in children and adolescents: Is there a sensitivity for processing rewarding feedback?","Developmental studies indicate that children rely more on external feedback than adults. Some of these studies claim that they additionally show higher sensitivity toward positive feedback, while others find they preferably use negative feedback for learning. However, these studies typically did not disentangle feedback valence and expectancy, which might contribute to the controversial results. The present study aimed at examining the neurophysiological correlates of feedback processing in children (8–10 years) and adolescents (12–14 years) in a time estimation paradigm that allows separating the contribution of valence and expectancy. Our results show that in the feedback-related negativity (FRN), an event-related potential (ERP) reflecting the fast initial processing of feedback stimuli, children and adolescents did not differentiate between unexpected positive and negative feedback. Thus, they did not show higher sensitivity to positive feedback. The FRN did also not differentiate between expected and unexpected feedback, as found for adults. In contrast, in a later processing stage mirrored in the P300 component of the ERP, children and adolescents processed the feedback's unexpectedness. Interestingly, adolescents with better behavioral adaptation (high-performers) also had a more frontal P300 expectancy effect. Thus, the recruitment of additional frontal brain regions might lead to better learning from feedback in adolescents.

"1066","The social, behavioral, and emotional correlates of bullying and victimization in a school-based sample","Bullying is a prevalent problem in schools that is associated with a number of negative outcomes for both the child who bullies and his or her victims. In a community sample of 284 ethnically diverse school-children (54.2 % girls) between the ages of 9 and 14 years (M = 11.28, SD = 1.82), the current study examined whether the level of victimization moderated the association between bullying and several behavioral, social, and emotional characteristics. These characteristics were specifically chosen to integrate research on distinct developmental pathways to conduct problems with research on the characteristics shown by children who bully others. Results indicated that both bullying and victimization were independently associated with conduct problems. However, there was an interaction between bullying and victimization in the prediction of callous-unemotional (CU) traits, such that the association between bullying and CU traits was stronger for those lower on victimization. Further, bullying was positively associated with positive attitudes towards bullying and anger expression and neither of these associations were moderated by the level of victimization. In contrast, bullying was not associated with the child’s perceived problems regulating anger, suggesting that children with higher levels of bullying admit to expressing anger but consider this emotional expression as being under their control.

"1067","The psychological dimensions of placebo-studies: Recommendations for study designs","The placebo effect involves a complex network of psychological variables that are often disregarded by studies enquiring into this effect. It is hence little surprising that these psychological variables confound study outcomes and that experiments investigating the placebo effect often yield radically different results. The current article identifies three categories of psychological and methodological factors that are not systematically considered in placebo research: psychological confounds (Hawthorne effects and demand effects); methodological and data-analysis issues; and clinicians’ expectancy effects. These factors are not necessarily to be seen as mere artifacts, however, because they may constitute favorable components of the placebo effect. A set of benchmark criteria is therefore proposed to allow researchers to capitalize on these components during placebo research rather than have their results confounded by them; and to allow for a more reliable interpretation of study outcomes.

"1068","The role of syntactic and discourse information in verb learning","Children use syntax in verb learning; this is syntactic bootstrapping (Gleitman, 1990; Naigles, 1990). This dissertation proposal investigates two research questions about syntactic bootstrapping: 1) how syntactic bootstrapping could begin, and 2) how syntactic bootstrapping could work despite noisy input due to argument omission. The first three sets of experiments (Chapters 2) showed that 15- to 19-month-old infants use the number of nouns in a sentence to differentiate novel transitive and intransitive verbs. The results confirm a key prediction of structure-mapping account (Fisher, 1996) suggesting that syntactic bootstrapping might begin with an unlearned bias to assign each noun in the sentence to a core participant-role in conceptual representations of events. Experiments 4 and 5 (Chapter 3) showed that Korean-learning 2-year-old children exploit distributional and discourse information to find true number of arguments of a new verb despite pervasive argument omission. Finally, Chapter 4 (Experiment 6, 7 and 8) asked whether a bias to discourse continuity could aid children's verb interpretation even in English that allows noun omission only in restricted situations. The results showed that English-learning children also could use discourse continuity to interpret verbs with missing subjects. Taken together, the results of these studies support the conclusion that the inherent one-to-one mapping bias can guide children's verb learning even in noisy input in any language, with children's expectation for discourse continuity.

"1069","Essays on multicategory dependence models of consumer choice","This research concentrates on understanding the dynamic choice behavior of households using econometric models; specifically the influence of promotional campaigns and cross-category dependencies on purchase incidence outcomes. In the first section, we empirically estimate the expected basket-level demand effects and, therefore, the expected store profit effects of three different types of retailer targeted coupon campaigns used by a national supermarket retail chain. The three types of campaigns differ in terms of household-level personalization. One campaign employs a one-to-one approach by targeting a set of selected households with a unique bundle of coupons personalized to that household's preferences (high personalization). Another campaign promotes a bundle of brands around a theme (i.e., back-to-school) relevant to the household (medium personalization). The third type provides a limited number of coupons for one brand in a single category relevant to the consumer (low personalization). We build and estimate an econometric model of a household's contemporaneous purchase incidence outcomes in 28 product categories, together with a household-level store choice model. In terms of relative efficacy, we find that theme-based coupons (medium personalization) lead to more incremental expected retailer profits for a small number of coupons (e.g. 5--7) when dropped in a single category (e.g. fresh vegetables). However, due to higher degrees of freedom, one-to-one coupons (high personalization) generate an even greater expected retailer profit when bundling coupons across a large number of categories (e.g. 20). In the second section, we attempt to advance the literature on multi-category demand models by modeling cross-category dependencies in households' purchase incidence outcomes. We propose an extended version of the Multivariate Logit Model of Russell and Peterson (2000) that enables the estimation of higher-order cross-category dependencies. We document both positive and negative higher order cross-category dependences in consumer demand. This systematic demand structure analysis allowed us to find a counterintuitive bundle of hot dogs, non-cola beverages and toilet paper which generated the highest expect revenues. The results from our studies provide insights to retailers about the value of investing in more personalized promotional efforts, and with a detailed cross-category glimpse of where such value is gained.

In the original article, six instances of 'dependent variables' were incorrectly included as 'DV' instead of 'DVs'. This has been corrected in the print and online versions.] Cyberbullying incidents often occur in the presence of other bystanders. The inaction of bystanders can augment the deleterious effects of bullying on a victim. However, bystanders can intervene to stop a cyberbullying incident or offer support to the victim. Two studies were conducted to examine variables that were expected to influence the propensity of a bystander to take action in cyberbullying incidents: the number of bystanders, the anonymity of the bystander, and the closeness between the bystander and the victim. Results supported the diffusion of responsibility effect. A higher number of bystanders was negatively associated with bystander intervention. Moreover, the perceived anonymity of bystanders was negatively related to the propensity to intervene, and closeness with the victim was associated with a greater tendency to intervene and support the victim. Altogether, the results shed light on the interplay of context, relationships, and technology in the behavior of bystanders to a cyberbullying episode.

"1071","The influence of parental mental health and family psychosocial functioning on bystander behavior of elementary school children","Being the victim of school bullying is associated with many negative outcomes, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, school refusal, and suicide. Peer bystanders are present in the majority of bullying situations and bystander intervention has been found to be a significant factor in ending a bullying incident. However, most of the time bystanders do not intervene on behalf of the victim. The present study investigated the impact of parental and familial influences on children's bystander behavior. Seventy-three third- through sixth-grade students were given the Participant Role Scale to measure their behavior in bullying situations (engaging in bullying behavior, assisting or reinforcing the bully, defending the victim, or staying away from the situation altogether). Their mothers completed a number of measures that evaluated symptoms of depression (CES-D), quality of the parent-child relationship (PRQ), and parental responses and experiences of anger (STAXI-II). Stepwise multiple regression analyses identified the subset of potential predictor variables that significantly predicted each bullying role behavior. Key findings were: (a) higher parental relationship frustration was related to both lower defender behavior and higher outsider behavior in children; (b) children whose parents have lower satisfaction with their school were more likely to engage in bullying behavior; (c) parental experiences of expressing and controlling anger were found to predict a child's defender behavior; and (d) child age predicted bystander behavior. Assistant behavior and reinforcer behavior were not predicted by any of the independent variables or by any demographic variables. Strengths and limitations, along with practical implications, are discussed.

"1072","The semantics of optionality","For every participant role filler in an utterance, speakers must choose to leave it bare (e.g., ""the interviewer"") or to modify it (e.g., ""the interviewer on Fresh Air""). Their decision is the end result of a combination of complex factors ranging from the original message to how distracted the speaker is. When we use corpora to create language models, part of our job is understanding the observable properties in and around an event description that allow us to predict these decisions. A considerable body of work on language production and discourse pragmatics concentrates on measuring noun phrase predictability and other forms of shared knowledge that help determine the balance point between over- and under-specification of a participant role filler. Although the importance of predictability as measured by long-term probabilities has long been recognized, I present a novel quantitative analysis of participant role filler predictability, the structure of the mental lexicon, and how the interaction of these two inform a speaker's internal perception of informativity. Standard Gricean assumptions tend to be efficiency oriented. Speakers will be informative enough but not wastefully so. Using these to model corpus distributions predict that noun phrase modification rates are directly proportional to predictability in order to satisfy the speaker's obligation to always be informative. In contrast, standard Firthian models (built around the idea that ""you know a word by the company it keeps"") assume spreading activation—and not efficiency—is the dominant predictor of usage. Sensitivity to activation's effect predicts that noun phrase modification rates are inversely proportional to predictability. Strongly connected participant role fillers could be easily activated for production while weakly connected participant role fillers would either be mentioned less often or themselves trigger strongly connected features (not normally associated with the head verb) to be primed for production. To distinguish between these competing assumptions, I analyze participant role filler modification rates in event descriptions with respect to three indicators: the syntactic and semantic optionality of the role filler, the general predictability of the verb's role fillers, and the predictability of individual pairs of verb/participant role fillers. First, I use insights from linguistic theory to classify verbs and their participant roles into classes of syntactic optionality and semantic optionality. Second, I quantify over a large corpus the general predictability of a verb's participant roles and the specific predictability of each pair of verb/participant role filler. Finally, I model the relationship between the three indicators and modification in order to ascertain whether speakers have a stronger tendency to modify the more predictable participant role fillers, as Grice's Maxim of Relevancy predicts, or a tendency to modify the less predictable participant role fillers, as a Firthian activation-based model predicts. I present descriptive statistical models to chart the relationship between predictability, syntactic optionality of a participant role, and semantic optionality of a participant role. In general, verb classes with stronger mental lexicon connections to their participant role fillers according to theory also have more predictable participant role fillers in the British National Corpus. Specifically, syntactically optional direct object verbs and semantically obligatory instrument verbs have more predictable participant role fillers than the opposite, comparable verb class. I also present several linear mixed-effect models to determine how predictive of modification the independent variables of syntactic verb class, semantic verb class, and verb/participant role filler predictability are.

"1073","Defenders of victims of peer aggression: Interdependence theory and an exploration of individual, interpersonal, and contextual effects on the defender participant role","The research on predictors and effects of defending victims of peer victimization and bullying continues to grow, but most research on this topic is lacking a strong theoretical framework. This review of defending research introduces interdependence theory as a theory with the capacity to organize many of the empirical findings from the existing defending literature into a meaningful whole. Other theories used to frame defending research are described, and limitations of these theories are discussed. Framing defending research within interdependence theory leads to new research questions. These include: (1) who defends whom and why?, (2) through what processes do individuals in the peer group internalize peer group norms in regard to peer victimization, and how do these internalized norms affect individual perceptions and beliefs that then guide behavior?, and (3) what are the individual and interpersonal factors that affect whether bystanders defend peers, and how does intervention in peer victimization situations affect defenders in addition to victims? Framing defending research within interdependence theory allows for the organization of previous findings and will guide new research.

"1074","Prosocial bystander behavior in bullying dynamics: Assessing the impact of social capital","Individuals who observe a bullying event, but are not directly involved as a bully or victim, are referred to as bystanders. Prosocial bystanders are those individuals who actively intervene in bullying dynamics to support the victim and this prosocial behavior often ends the bullying. The current study examines how social capital in the form of social support, community engagement, mental health functioning, and positive school experiences and characteristics is associated with the likelihood of engaging in prosocial bystander behavior in a large sample ( N = 5752; 51.03 % female) of racially/ethnically diverse rural youth. It was hypothesized that social capital would be associated with an increased likelihood of engaging in prosocial bystander behavior. Following multiple imputation, an ordered logistic regression with robust standard errors was run. The hypothesis was partially supported and results indicated that social capital in the form of friend and teacher support, ethnic identity, religious orientation, and future optimism were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of engaging in prosocial bystander behavior. Contrary to the hypothesis, a decreased rate of self-esteem was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of engaging in prosocial bystander behavior. The findings highlight the importance of positive social relationships and community engagement in increasing prosocial bystander behavior and ultimately decreasing school bullying. Implications were discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)","","","","","","Evans, Caroline B.

"1075","Refilling the half-empty glass—Investigating the potential role of the Interpretation Modification Paradigm for Depression (IMP-D)","Background and objectives: Cognitive biases are known to cause and maintain depression. However, little research has been done on techniques targeting interpretation tendencies found in depression, despite the promising findings of anxiety studies. This paper presents two experiments, investigating the suitability of an Interpretation Modification Paradigm for Depression (IMP-D) in healthy individuals, which has already proven its effectiveness in anxiety (Beard &amp; Amir, 2008). Different from other paradigms, the IMP-D aims at modifying an interpretation bias on response- and on a more implicit reaction time-level, making this task less susceptible to demand effects. Methods: The Word–Sentence Association Paradigm for Depression (Hindash &amp; Amir, 2011) was modified and administered in healthy volunteers (experiment I: N = 81; experiment II: N = 105). To enhance a positive interpretation bias, endorsing benign and rejecting negative interpretations of ambiguous scenarios was reinforced through feedback. This intervention was compared to the opposite training (both experiments) and a control training (experiment II only). Results: Both experiments revealed a significant increase in bias towards benign interpretations on the level of overt decisions, while only in the first experiment a change was found on a reaction time level. These modifications are not reflected in group-differences in emotional vulnerability. Limitations: Possible limitations regarding the reliability of inter-dependent response and reaction time measures are discussed. Conclusions: The IMP-D is able to modify interpretation biases, but adaptations are required to maximize its beneficial effects.

Fifth- and seventh-grade students ( N = 206; M age = 11.13 and 13.18 years, respectively) completed online questionnaires about gender-consistent videotaped hypothetical bullying scenarios in which the victims' responses (angry, sad, confident, ignoring) were experimentally manipulated. Victims' responses significantly influenced bystanders' attitudes towards the victim, perceptions of the victimization, emotional reactions, and behavioral intentions. In general, angry victims elicited more negative reactions, sad victims elicited greater intentions to act, while incidents involving confident victims were perceived as less serious. Several variations depending on the bullying type and students' grade, gender, and personal experiences with bullying were evident.

"1078","The white-man effect: How foreigner presence affects behavior in experiments","We experimentally vary white foreigner presence in dictator games across 60 villages in Sierra Leone, and find that the simple presence of a white foreigner increases player contributions by 19 percent. To separate the impact of the white foreigner's race and nationality from other characteristics, we test additional predictions. First, the white foreigner's presence may heighten demand effects, prompting players to try to impress the white foreigner by being more generous. This should make behavior in the game less indicative of true generosity. Consistent with this, we find that game contributions are no longer predicted by real-world public good contributions when the white foreigner is present. Second, those more familiar with aid may perceive the games as a form of means-testing, and therefore give less to signal that they are poor. Consistent with this, in the presence of the white foreigner, players in more aid-exposed villages give less, and are more likely to believe that the games are testing them for aid suitability. Together, these results suggest that players’ giving decisions respond to the white foreigner's race and nationality. Behavioral measures are increasingly used to infer cross-national differences in social preferences or to assess aid effectiveness—our results suggest that we should be cautious in these uses.

Four- and 6-year-old children participated in a play event in Session 1. During a two-week delay, parents presented their children with either misinformation or correct information about the play event. Prior to a memory interview in Session 2, some misled children were given a developmentally appropriate logic-of-opposition instruction to not report information provided by their parents. Results indicated that children were misled by the incorrect information, but that the logic-of-opposition instruction aided in the children's retrieval of the original memory, particularly for the 6-year-olds.

To estimate the demand effects, we introduced videos displaying apparel with matching accessories for a few randomly selected apparel on a fashion retailer’s website. We found that introducing a video resulted in a 14.5% increase in apparel sales and a 28.3% increase in accessories sales. The estimated increase in accessories sales was largely attributed to the spillover effect of videos. Moreover, introducing videos with other product promotions resulted in a significantly higher effect of videos on product demands. Overall, we show how video display of related products can increase their demands in an online product network.

This study investigates the influence of supply and demand competence on supply chain flexibility and its influence on a firm's operational and relational performance. While the former competence refers to production and supply management-related activities, the latter refers to distribution and demand management-related activities. Within this framework, process compliance, that is, how well supply chain management processes are internally executed by the firm's employees, is observed as an enabler (moderator) on the relationship between supply chain competence and supply chain flexibility. Further, the model also explores the moderating influence of environmental uncertainty on the linkage between supply chain flexibility and firm performance. The model is empirically validated based on perceptual data collected from 163 supply chain professionals through web-based survey. Implications for both managers as well as practitioners are also provided.

In particular, participant role perspectives (e.g., models in which bullying is conceptualized in the context of multiple participants) serve as an overarching frame for examining and formulating hypotheses about two additional types of determinants: (a) child attributes—specifically, the role of children's person-related development (i.e., social-cognitive, emotion, and moral processing), and (b) children's experience with multiple socializing agents (i.e., peers and teachers). Empirical evidence is reviewed to identify relevant constructs, and critical analyses of evidence within and across conceptual domains are utilized to formulate novel hypotheses about how person- and relational-level (socialization) processes may contribute to individual differences in bullying and bystanding behaviors.

Participants were 6,708 third- to fifth-grade children (49% boys; Mage = 11 years) from 383 classrooms. Multilevel modeling analyses revealed that children were more likely to defend in response to their affective empathy in classrooms with high levels of bullying. In addition, popular students were more likely to support victims in classrooms where bullying was associated with social costs.

The target sample contained fourth- to sixth-grade students (n = 2,051) who attended the control schools in the Finnish evaluation of the KiVa antibullying program. Random slope multilevel analyses revealed that, over time, higher popularity or rejection, or lower acceptance were associated with increases in bullying behaviors, especially in classrooms with a high descriptive bullying norm.

Finally, we test if parental support moderates the relationship between fatalism and two bystander behaviors. Based on 3,441 students from 20 middle schools in Taiwan, results support the mediation hypotheses that the relationships of past victimization with defender and outsider behaviors are mediated through fatalism. Furthermore, the results support the moderation hypotheses that parental support is positively associated with defender behavior even when the level of fatalism is high. Future school bullying prevention research and practice may benefit from understanding how to reduce fatalistic belief and strengthen parental support.

Two Olweus-like global items and a revised School Bullying Severity Scale for elementary students were used in this study. A total of 1816 valid surveys completed by students in grades 5 and 6 (mean age = 11.5, SD = .84) were collected. Data were analysed using a mixed-model two-way ANOVA. The results revealed a significant main effect of type of bullying. Physical and verbal bullying were perceived as more severe than relational and cyberbullying. A significant two-way interaction between bullying category and participant role was also identified. Bullies did not perceive the four types of victimisation behaviours differently, whereas victims and bullies/victims both rated physical victimisation as most severe and cyber-victimisation as least severe. However, effect sizes were small. Implications for bullying prevention and intervention are discussed.

A comparison of online and offline witnesses to bullying and their bystander behaviour","Given their ubiquitous presence as witnesses to school-yard bullying, the role of the ‘bystander’ has been studied extensively. The prevalence and behaviour of bystanders to cyberbullying , however, is less understood. In an anonymous, school-based questionnaire, 716 secondary school students from South-East Queensland reported whether they had witnessed traditional and/or cyberbullying, and how they responded to each type. Overlap in bystander roles between online and offline environments was examined, as was their relationship to age and gender. Students who witnessed traditional bullying were more likely to have witnessed cyberbullying. Bystanders’ behaviour was sometimes similar in both contexts of traditional and cyberbullying, mainly if they were outsiders but half of the 256 students who reported witnessing both traditional and cyberbullying, acted in different roles across the two environments. The implications of the findings are discussed in the context of previous research on cyberbullying and traditional-bystanders. Future research should further explore the role of bystanders online, including examining whether known predictors of traditional-bystander behaviour similarly predict cyber-bystander behaviour.

However, novel aspects of the participant role were the source of most ethical challenges. We theorize that the shift in ethical focus from subject to participant will pose new ethical dilemmas for community-engaged investigators and for other constituents interested in increasing community involvement in health research.

Many empirical studies have supported the predictions of the Pygmalion effect, but the effect sizes have tended to be small to moderate. Furthermore, almost all existing studies have examined teacher expectancy effects on students' achievement at the student level only (does a specific student improve?) rather than at the classroom level (do classes improve when teachers have generally high expectations of their students?). The present study scrutinized the Pygmalion effect in a longitudinal study by using a large sample in regular classrooms and by differentiating between two achievement outcomes (grades and an achievement test) and two levels of analyses (the individual and classroom levels). Furthermore, students' self-concept was studied as a possible mediator of the teacher expectancy effect on achievement. Data come from a study with 73 teachers and their 1289 fifth-grade students. Multilevel regression analyses yielded three main results. First, Pygmalion effects were found at the individual level for both achievement outcomes. Second, multilevel mediation analyses showed that teacher expectancy effects were partly mediated by students' self-concept. Third, teachers' average expectancy effects at the class level were found to be nonsignificant when students' prior achievement was controlled.

Bystanders might be reticent to intervene because they are stuck in “social dilemmas.” Social dilemmas are situations in which individuals make decisions based on self-interest due to their lack of confidence that others will join with them in decisions that benefit the collective. In this study, the social dilemmas concept, which comes from game theory and social psychology, was applied to bullying for the first time. A total of 292 middle school students at a private residential school in the United States completed surveys about their bullying-related experiences within their residences of 10 to 12 students of the same gender. Multilevel modeling was employed to assess if and how attitudes, group norms, and social dilemmas predict behavior in bullying situations. The findings suggested that both individual and group factors were associated with behavior in bullying situations and that attitudes, group norms, and social dilemmas each made a unique contribution to predicting behavior in bullying situations.

The PRS questionnaire and items from the two BASC-2-SRP content scales were administered to 174 (91 females and 83 males; M = 9.86, SD = 1.00) children in third through fifth grades, and their self-endorsed levels of participation in bullying was assessed for goodness of fit with the five proposed participation roles of the PRS. Principal axis factor analysis supported a 2-factor solution (""Defenders"" (16 items) and ""Aggressors"" (8 items)), rather than the five originally put forth by Salmivalli et al. (1996). Regression analyses revealed that high scores on the Aggressor scale were positively related to Internalizing Problems and negatively related to Personal Adjustment. This finding is consistent with prior research indicating that children who bully are at higher risk of psychosocial deficits and problems later in life. Defender scores were not related to the measures of Internalizing Problems or Personal Adjustment. This finding is inconsistent with prior research indicating that witnesses to bullying are at increased risk of mental health difficulties including anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms. Future research should work to discover empirically supported, reliable measures for identifying bullying roles. The 2-factor structure found in this study (Aggressors and Defenders) should be verified with larger and more representative samples of elementary-aged children using confirmatory factor analysis. Additionally, further investigation is needed that examines mental health implications for involvement in bullying situations, especially among witnesses.

"1097","The representation and processing of participant role information","In this chapter, I have suggested that participant role information is represented both as situation-based verb-specific role-filler concepts, as suggested by the verb specific concepts view advocated by Ken McRae and his colleagues, and as more abstract semantically required participant roles or role properties, as suggested by the lexical encoding hypothesis developed by me and my collaborators. I have also presented evidence that at least one of these types of participant role information does not appear to be automatically activated when a verb is encountered. An article found no evidence of facilitatory instrument priming when the possibility of strategic responding was eliminated. Whether semantically required participant role information is automatically activated is as yet unclear. Finally, I discussed how these two aspects of participant role representation might influence language comprehension. While it is clear that participant role information is used to guide syntactic attachment decisions, the extant data are silent on which type of participant role information is used. Evidence from filler-gap studies provides clear evidence that participant role information is used to facilitate the semantic integration of WH fillers into developing sentence representations. Evidence from an study suggests that situation-based participant role information is used since it is required for evaluating the plausibility of WH fillers. Evidence from an article demonstrates that semantically required participant role information also facilitates the semantic integration of WH fillers above and beyond the influence of role-filler typicality or probability of being mentioned. Finally, both sources of participant role information are used to anticipate the mention of participant role fillers. However, when these two sources of information are used depends on how quickly they become available and the type and availability of other sources of constraint.

"1098","Cognitive science perspectives on verb representation and processing","Verbs play an important role in how events, states and other ""happenings"" are mentally represented and how they are expressed in natural language. Besides their central role in linguistics, verbs have long been prominent topics of research in analytic philosophy— mostly on the nature of events and predicate-argument structure—and a topic of empirical investigation in psycholinguistics, mostly on argument structure and its role in sentence comprehension. More recently, the representation of verb meaning has been gaining momentum as a topic of research in other cognitive science branches, notably neuroscience and the psychology of concepts. The present volume is an expression of this recent surge in the investigation of verb structure and meaning from the interdisciplinary perspective of cognitive science, with up-to-date contributions by theoretical linguists, philosophers, psycholinguists and neuroscientists. The volume presents new theoretical and empirical studies on how verb structure and verb meaning are represented, how they are processed during language comprehension, how they are acquired, and how they are neurologically implemented. Cognitive Science Perspectives on Verb Representation and Processing is a reflection of the recent collaboration between the disciplines that constitute cognitive science, bringing new empirical data and theoretical insights on a key element of natural language and conceptualization.

"1099","Effectiveness of the KiVa antibullying programme on bully-victims, bullies and victims","Background: Bullying is a widespread problem in schools. Although several effective school-based bullying intervention programmes have been developed to reduce bullying and victimisation, it has rarely been investigated whether intervention programmes are also effective in helping bully-victims. Purpose: This study investigates the effectiveness of the KiVa antibullying programme in reducing the prevalence of bully-victims, compared with those defined as ‘pure bullies’ and ‘pure victims’. Programme description: The KiVa antibullying programme is a national anti-bullying programme in Finland. It consists of universal actions targeting all the students through student lessons and virtual learning environments (e.g. anti-bullying computer games), and indicated actions , i.e. tackling the acute bullying cases. The programme aims at reducing bullying and victimisation by changing the responses of bystanders witnessing bullying. Sample: The target sample consisted of 23,520 participants (age range 8–15 years) from 738 intervention classrooms and 647 control classrooms in 195 Finnish schools. There were 12,450 primary (grades 2–6, 52.9%) and 11,070 secondary (grades 8–9, 47.1%) school students. Design and methods: The pre- and post-test data were collected in two waves 12 months apart, always in the end of a school year. The KiVa intervention took place during one school year, i.e. nine months. The effects on bully-victims, as well as on pure bullies and pure victims, were examined by prevalence changes as well as two-level multinomial logistic regression analyses. Results: The prevalence changes of bully-victims in intervention schools, in comparison with control schools, were -8% and -41% when identified by self-reports and peer-.reports, respectively. Controlling for student gender, school level (primary/secondary) and pretest bullying/victimisation status, the odds of being a bully-victim after the intervention year were 1.51 (self-reports) and 1.63 (peer-reports) times higher for a student in a control school, in comparison with a student in an intervention school. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that KiVa is effective in reducing the prevalence of bully-victims, and these effects are comparable or even larger than the effects on pure bullies and pure victims. It is possible that intervention for bully-victims might not be more difficult than that for bullies and victims.

"1100","Reducing bullying and victimization: Student- and classroom-level mechanisms of change","This longitudinal study examines the mediating mechanisms by which the KiVa antibullying program, based on the Participant Role approach, reduces bullying and victimization among elementary school students. Both student-level mechanisms leading to reduced perpetration of bullying and classroom-level mechanisms leading to reductions in bullying and victimization are considered. Analyses are based on a sample of 7,491 students (49.5 % boys) nested within 421 classrooms within 77 schools. At the beginning of program implementation, the children were in Grades 4, 5, and 6 (mean age 11.3 years). Multilevel structural equation modeling was used to analyze whether changes in the hypothesized mediators accounted for later reductions in the outcomes. At the student level, antibullying attitudes and perceptions regarding peers’ defending behaviors and teacher attitudes toward bullying mediated the effects of KiVa on self-reported bullying perpetration. The effects on peer-reported bullying were only mediated by antibullying attitudes. At the classroom level, the program effects on both self- and peer-reported bullying were mediated by students’ collective perceptions of teacher attitudes toward bullying. Also, perceived reinforcing behaviors predicted bullying but did not emerge as a significant mediator. Finally, bullying mediated the effects of the classroom-level factors on victimization. These findings enhance knowledge of the psychosocial developmental processes contributing to bullying and victimization and shed light on the key mechanisms by which school bullying can successfully be counteracted.

"1101","Adaptation of the Participant Role Scale (PRS) in a Spanish youth sample: Measurement invariance across gender and relationship with sociometric status","In recent years, bullying research has transitioned from investigating the characteristics of the bully–victim dyad to examining bullying as a group-level process, in which the majority of children play some kind of role. This study used a shortened adaptation of the Participant Role Scale (PRS) to identify these roles in a representative sample of 2,050 Spanish children aged 8 to 13 years. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed three different roles, indicating that the adapted scale remains a reliable way to distinguish the Bully, Defender, and Outsider roles. In addition, measurement invariance of the adapted scale was examined to analyze possible gender differences among the roles. Peer status was assessed separately by gender through two sociometric procedures: the nominations-based method and the ratings-based method. Across genders, children in the Bully role were more often rated as rejected, whereas Defenders were more popular. Results suggest that although the PRS can reveal several different peer roles in the bullying process, a more clear distinction between bullying roles (i.e., Bully, Assistant, and Reinforcer) could better inform strategies for bullying interventions.

"1102","Reasoning about single-sex schooling for girls among students, parents, and teachers","The number of United States public schools offering single-sex education for girls has increased dramatically in the past decade. Rationales for all-girls schools are diverse and grounded in differing gender ideologies. We examined reasoning about all-girls schools among school stakeholders (i.e., individuals affected by single-sex schools, including students, parents, and teachers) in the Southwestern United States. Specifically, middle school students attending all-girls ( n = 398) and coeducational ( n = 191) schools, mothers of middle school students attending all-girls ( n = 217) and coeducational ( n = 64) schools, and teachers employed at all-girls ( n = 18) and coeducational ( n = 97) middle schools rated the veracity of multiple rationales for girls-only schools. Specifically, we examined rationales for single-sex schooling related to gender differences in learning, gender differences in interests, girls’ ingroup preference, and gender discrimination. Endorsement of rationales differed across participant role (student, parent, teacher) and school type (single-sex, coeducational). Overall, stakeholders affiliated with an all-girls school were more supportive of each rationale than stakeholders affiliated with coeducational schools. Teachers affiliated with the single-sex school strongly endorsed gender differences in learning as a rationale for single-sex schooling. Endorsement of rationales did not vary across participant gender. The implications of these findings for educational policy and the interpretation of research on single-sex schooling are discussed.

"1103","When boys wear pink: A gendered color cue violation evokes risk taking","A primary way to signal gender differences starting in infancy is via a clothing color cue (pink is for girls, not boys). We examined whether a violation of this seemingly innocuous gendered prescription would lead to differential decision making regarding infants’ health and well being. In Experiment 1, participants were given an adaptation of the Asian Disease Problem (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981) describing a flu outbreak expected to affect male infants, who were dressed in pink or blue. Participants tended to choose the risk-averse treatment for boys in blue, consistent with Tversky and Kahneman’s theorizing and findings. In contrast, participants tended to opt for the risk-taking treatment for boys in pink, consistent with research highlighting people’s tendency to place lower subjective value on the lives of individuals who belong to socially devalued groups. Experiment 2 ruled out a possible expectancy effect with a different natural category. We discuss the reification of clothing color for demarcating masculinity as a societal attempt at policing gender and situate the findings in a cognitive consistency framework.

"1104","College students' behavioral reactions upon witnessing relational peer aggression","With a sample of 228 college students (82.5% females) from the Midwestern United States, individual factors that contribute to emerging adults' behavioral responses when witnessing relational aggression among their peers were explored. The experience of witnessing relational aggression was found to be systematically associated with college students' behavioral responses to relational aggression through two social cognitive processes: normative beliefs about relational aggression and susceptibility to peer influence. The experience of witnessing relational aggression was associated with defending behavior through normative beliefs about relational aggression and both assisting and reinforcing behavior through normative beliefs about relational aggression and susceptibility to peer influence. The experience of witnessing relational aggression was also associated with onlooking behavior through normative beliefs about relational aggression. The findings indicate that exposure to relational aggression as a witness may influence witness responses because of the way such exposure may shape specific social cognitions. The potential for using the study findings for promoting effective witness interventions among college students is discussed.

"1105","A social network approach to the interplay between adolescents’ bullying and likeability over time","Our knowledge on adolescents’ bullying behavior has rapidly increased over the past decade and it is widely recognized that bullying is a group process and, consequently, context-dependent. Only since recently, though, researchers have had access to statistical programs to study these group processes appropriately. The current 1-year longitudinal study examined the interplay between adolescents’ bullying and likeability from a social network perspective. Data came from the evaluation of the Finnish KiVa antibullying program, consisting of students in grades 7–9 (N = 9,183, M age at wave 1 = 13.96 years; 49.2 % boys; M classroom size = 19.47) from 37 intervention and 30 control schools. Perceived popularity, gender, and structural network effects were additionally controlled. Longitudinal social network analysis with SIENA revealed that, overall, the higher the students’ level of bullying, the less they were liked by their peers. Second, students liked peers with similar levels of bullying and this selection-similarity effect was stronger at low levels of bullying. This selection effect held after controlling for selection-similarity in perceived popularity and gender. Third, students were likely to increase in bullying when they liked peers high on bullying and to decrease in bullying when they liked peers low on bullying. Again, this influence effect held after controlling for the effects of perceived popularity and gender on changes in bullying behavior. No significant differences between control and intervention schools appeared in the effects. The results are discussed in light of their theoretical and methodological implications.

"1106","Motivational and cognitive determinants of control during conflict processing","Previous studies suggest that both reward anticipation and expected or experienced conflicts activate cognitive control. The present study investigated how these factors interact during conflict processing. In two experiments, participants performed a variant of the Stroop task, receiving performance-dependent monetary rewards in some blocks. In addition, we manipulated the level of conflict-triggered reactive and expectancy-driven proactive control: In Experiment 1, we compared the Stroop effect after previously congruent and incongruent trials to examine the conflict adaptation effect (reactive control). We found that the level of motivation did not interact with conflict adaptation. In Experiment 2, we varied the proportion of congruent and incongruent trials to manipulate conflict expectancy (proactive control). The data suggest the effects of motivation to be less pronounced under conditions of high conflict expectancy. We conclude that the interaction of motivation with cognitive determinants of control depends on whether these activate proactive or reactive control processes.

"1108","Friendship selection and influence in bullying and defending: Effects of moral disengagement","The current study examined the development of bullying and defending over a 1-year period as related to friends’ influence and individual and friends’ moral disengagement (i.e., self-justification mechanisms that allow one to avoid moral self-censure of transgressive actions) in children and young adolescents. Via longitudinal social network analysis (RSiena), it was tested whether similarity between friends in bullying and defending developed over time due to friends’ influence, while controlling for friendship selection processes, and whether there were differences in these processes between children (age 9–10 years; n = 133; 42.9% girls) and young adolescents (age 11–14 years; n = 236; 40.6% girls). Results showed that individuals selected peers as friends who were similar in bullying and became more similar to friends in bullying over time, but only in early adolescence. Moreover, there was marginal support that friends’ influence was stronger in young adolescents with higher moral disengagement. In early adolescence, bullying was also indirectly influenced through friends’ moral disengagement, with different effects for boys and girls. With regard to defending, young adolescents maintained friendships with peers who were similar in defending, and became more similar to friends in terms of defending over time. These findings suggest important differences between late childhood and early adolescence in socialization processes and indicate that in early adolescence, friends’ influence on the development of bullying is partially affected by moral disengagement.

"1109","Setbacks, pleasant surprises and the simply unexpected: Brainwave responses in a language comprehension task","This event-related potential (ERP) study explored the behaviour of N400 and post-N400 frontal positivities (pN400FP) during the processing of emotionally biased and unbiased sentences that randomly led to highly expected or unexpected word outcomes. Unexpected outcomes (as determined by sentence completion written tests) elicited significantly larger N400 and pN400FP responses than did highly expected outcomes. Emotionally neutral outcomes triggered a significant N400 expectancy effect across all scalp locations, including frontal sites, whereas emotionally biased outcomes elicited a significant N400 effect localized to posterior scalp regions. The subsequent pN400FP effect was significant only when emotional expectations were violated and not when emotionally neutral sentences led to unexpected outcomes. This frontal effect, linked to the processing of lexically unexpected but plausible words, showed larger amplitudes for unexpected pleasant surprises than for unexpected setbacks. Our results support the view that the pN400FP response to unexpected verbal outcomes entails more than a generic reaction to a lexical 'misprediction'. Rather, they favour the hypothesis that the affective content of the sentence being processed influences the effort needed to override a lexical prediction, such that more effort is needed to override a pessimistic prediction than an optimistic one.

"1110","Inequality matters: Classroom status hierarchy and adolescents’ bullying","The natural emergence of status hierarchies in adolescent peer groups has long been assumed to help prevent future intragroup aggression. However, clear evidence of this beneficial influence is lacking. In fact, few studies have examined between-group differences in the degree of status hierarchy (defined as within-group variation in individual status) and how they are related to bullying, a widespread form of aggression in schools. Data from 11,296 eighth- and ninth-graders (mean age = 14.57, 50.6 % female) from 583 classes in 71 schools were used to determine the direction of the association between classroom degree of status hierarchy and bullying behaviors, and to investigate prospective relationships between these two variables over a 6-month period. Multilevel structural equation modeling analyses showed that higher levels of classroom status hierarchy were concurrently associated with higher levels of bullying at the end of the school year. Higher hierarchy in the middle of the school year predicted higher bullying later in the year. No evidence was found to indicate that initial bullying predicted future hierarchy. These findings highlight the importance of a shared balance of power in the classroom for the prevention of bullying among adolescents.

Although patient-centered care (PCC) may aim to be tailored to an individual’s needs, the uses of CS for generating ideas, identifying values, solving problems, facilitating research, and educating an audience represent powerful roles that can shape both allocation of shared resources and delivery of personalized care and treatment. CS can often be conducted quickly and at relatively low cost. Pitfalls include bias, risks of research ethics, inadequate quality of data, inadequate metrics, and observer-expectancy effect. Health professionals and consumers in the US should increase their attention to CS for the benefit of PCC. Patients’ participation in CS to shape health policy and decisions is one way to pursue PCC itself and may help to improve clinical outcomes through a better understanding of patients’ perspectives. CS should especially be used to traverse the quality-cost curve, or decrease costs while preserving or improving quality of care.

In Experiment 1, participants studied a base version or an enhanced version of a paper-based lesson on how the Doppler Effect works with the expectation of taking a test on the material or with the expectation of teaching the material by providing a video-recorded lecture. Results indicated that those who prepared to teach (without actually teaching) outperformed those who prepared for a test on an immediate comprehension test (i.e., a teaching expectancy effect; d =.55), regardless of the format of the lesson. In Experiment 2, participants studied while expecting to be tested or expecting to teach the material; some then actually did teach the material by providing a video-recorded lecture, whereas others received additional study time. Results indicated that those who actually taught the material outperformed those who did not teach on a delayed comprehension test (i.e., a teaching effect; d =.56), though this effect was strongest for those who also prepared to teach. Overall, these findings are consistent with the idea that preparing to teach results in short-term learning gains, whereas the act of teaching (i.e., by explaining the material to others) coupled with preparing to teach is important for long-term learning.

Self-reported bystander behavior heavily depended on contextual factors, and should not be considered a fixed participant role. Bystanders preferred to handle cyberbullying offline and in person, and comforting the victim was considered more feasible than facing the bully. Most prevailing behavioral determinants to defend or support the victim were low moral disengagement, that the victim is an ingroup member, and that the bystander is popular. Youngsters felt they received little encouragement from their environment to perform positive bystanding behavior, since peers have a high acceptance for not defending and perceived parental support for defending behavior is largely lacking. These results suggest multilevel models for cyberbullying research, and interventions are needed. With much previous research into cyberbullying insufficiently founded in theoretical models, the employed framework of the Integrative Model and Social Cognitive Theory may inspire future studies into bystander behavior.

"1117","Going for gold: Investigating the (non)sense of increased advertising around major sports events","Major sports events draw unsurpassed media attention. Companies are motivated to increase their advertising investments around these events to reach large audiences in a short period. Is such an advertising surge actually beneficial though, or should companies avoid advertising in these periods because of negative effects of competitive interference? This study investigates when consumer packaged goods companies should invest in advertising to increase sales: before, during, or after the event or outside these event periods. The author estimates short - and long-term own- and cross-advertising elasticities for 206 brands using four years of weekly data. Although considerable heterogeneity exists across brands, own-advertising effectiveness diminishes especially before and during major sports events, in both the short and the long run. In addition, brands benefit less from category-demand effects through competitors' advertising. Conversely, greater increases in advertising spending resulting in significant growth in share of voice around focused, single-sport events are a successful strategy to overcome this overall general negative trend.

"1118","Bewältigung von cyberviktinnisierung im jugendalter—Emotionale und verhaltensbezogene reaktionen auf cyberbullying","The experience of cybervictimization is related to health, psychological, and behavioral problems among children and adolescents. Up to today research is scarce, how the persons affected by cybervictimization react and which determinants influence the choice for social, problem-focused, technical, or helpless coping behavior. The current online study with 428 adolescents considers age, sex, mean internet use, frequency of victimization, roles in cyberbullying, and emotional reactions to cybervictimization as potential determinants of the mentioned coping strategies. Based on the participant role approach, roles of cyberbullies, cybervictims, defenders or outsiders are frequently changing. Logistic regression analyses point out the important relevance of emotional reactions like anger or helplessness and the roles as cyberbully-victim or outsider. Further, younger participants reported cybervictimization more often, while the frequency of cybervictimization and sex did not and internet use only partially predict coping strategies. These findings corroborate the relevance of emotional reactions and the roles in the process of cyberbullying. As a starting point for prevention and intervention of cybervictimization, we suggest emotion regulation, teaching of technical coping behaviors as well as reflexion of roles in the context of cyberbullying. If feasible, different stakeholders should be engaged in this process: adolescents, parents, educational staff inside and outside of schools, experts from counseling and therapy as well as internet and mobile phone service providers.

"1119","Participant roles in aggression: Analysis of the overt and relational aggression participant role scales with confirmatory factor analysis","The peer group is a dynamic context within which children and adolescents have a wide range of experiences, both positive and negative. Friendships provide support and a sense of belonging; however, friendships can also be contexts within which competition and aggression occur. During childhood and adolescence, aggression and victimization are likely to occur in the school context and in situations where several members of the peer group are present and sometimes actively (or passively) participating. In the seminal work related to bullying as a group process, Salmivalli and colleagues identified distinct roles that children take when enacting aggression (Salmivalli et al., 1996). Salmivalli's work, in the area of participant roles, however, has focused on overt bullying, a specific subtype of aggression which has a specific meaning within the peer relations literature. To date, the participant roles have not been measured within the context of overt and relational aggression. The purpose of the present study is to examine the psychometric properties of the Overt Aggression Participant Role Scale (OAPRS) and the Relational Aggression Participant Role Scale (RAPRS), two new scales designed by the author, to measure the aggressor, assistant, reinforcer, defender, outsider, and victim roles during acts aggression, as opposed to bullying. Additional goals include: 1) exploring the associations among the roles, 2) examining measurement equivalence across gender and grade level, and 3) exploring associations of the participant roles with measures of sociometric status and depressive symptoms. Findings point toward the psychometric properties of the two scales being quite robust. The data fit the 12 factor model and the scales measure the constructs equivalently across gender and three grade groups. The aggressor, assistant, and reinforcer roles were strongly associated as were the aggressor and victim roles. Several relational roles were highly overlapping, suggesting reciprocity of roles. Few meaningful gender or grade level differences were found resulting in more similarity in the overt and relational roles than differences. The outsider role was the only role not associated with depressive symptoms. Implications for prevention and intervention are discussed.

"1120","Understanding school bullying: Its nature and prevention strategies","Bullying involves the repeated abuse of power in relationships. Bullying in schools can blight the lives of victims and damage the climate of the school. Over the last 25 years a burgeoning research program on school bullying has led to new insights into effective ways of dealing with it, as well as new challenges such as the advent of cyberbullying. This new book, by a leading international expert on the topic, brings together the cumulative knowledge acquired and the latest research findings in the area, with a global perspective especially covering research in Europe, North America, Australasia, and Asia. It will appeal to those taking academic courses in psychology, social work, educational psychology, child clinical psychology and psychiatry, and teacher training, but it will also be of interest to parents and teachers. Understanding School Bullying: Its Nature and Prevention Strategies should be indispensable reading for these groups and more; in fact, anyone concerned with the well-being of children and young people everywhere.

"1121","Moral emotion attributions and aggression","This chapter focuses on individual differences in the emotions children and adolescents expect various moral/immoral acts to produce and the relation of these moral emotion attributions to aggressive and antisocial tendencies. For example, do more aggressive children really expect aggression to have different emotional outcomes than their peers? And how can potential moral emotion attribution-aggression links be explained; what theoretical models can account for both general developmental patterns in children's moral emotion attributions as well as the emergence of important individual differences? The following review addresses the emerging literature on the connections between aggression and children's moral emotion attributions. A brief introductory section focuses on theoretical and developmental accounts of moral emotions with the goal of providing a context for the subsequent focus on individual differences. This is followed by sections that address early research on individual differences, as well as observational studies of young children's actual morally relevant emotions. The final sections describe some of the newer work on moral emotion attributions, including recent attempts to integrate research on moral emotion attributions with related concepts from the social information-processing literature.

"1122","School mental health: Views of services integration and attitudes toward evidence-based practice among multiple levels of school personnel","Purpose of the study. Through secondary data analysis of results from the School Mental Health Services Integration Survey (SMHSIS), this study describes indicators of school mental health integration preparedness, including role identification, willingness to engage in tasks associated with mental health services integration and implementation facilitators. The study also investigated the utility of a modified version of the Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS) for use with school staff. Study rationale . With as many as 20% of children meeting criteria for mental disorders that cause impairment, the gaps in mental health services delivery to this special needs population are evident and persistently problematic. Less than a third receive the services they need due to structural as well as attitudinal barriers to accessing services. Trends toward delivering services where children are located are noted and schools have emerged as de facto provider of mental health services to children. Yet, schools are not traditionally arranged or organized toward mental health services delivery, and though school-based mental health innovations are emerging there is no agreed upon unifying framework for integration of mental health services into school settings. Whereas school-based mental health is connecting to the evidence-base more often, evidence-based practices remain under-utilized. The present study examines school mental health services integration readiness in a large urban school district in central Florida. Methods. The SMHSIS was conducted by email and participants included seven group of professional staff, including principals and assistant principals, teachers, guidance counselors, social workers, psychologists, school resource officers, and school health staff. Data analysis involved exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of survey sections, in an effort to uncover indicators of readiness for school mental health integration preparedness in three domains, role identification, willingness, and implementation facilitators. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc tests were conducted to examine differences in perspectives on these domains, by professional group. Finally, a multiple regression model was used to examine the relationship between 6 predictor variables and a single continuous dependent variable, mean scores on the EBPAS. Results. EFA resulted in the identification of 6 variables in the domains of role identification, willingness, and implementation facilitators. Analysis of variance demonstrated significant differences by professional group in perspectives on these variables. In the role identification domain, social workers, school psychologists, and guidance counselors endorsed adoption of a provider role, and school principals and assistance principals as a group adopted a facilitator role. Social workers and psychologists were uniquely high and emerged as leaders in endorsing willingness to engage in tasks associated with mental health services delivery. However, it was noted that no group endorsed a non-willing, or non-participant role. Implementations facilitators were identified in the areas of overall organizational structure, individual support, and shared professional responsibility. Finally, a summary of the regression showed that indicates that 29.0% of the variance in EBPAS scores was explained by the 6 predictor variables. The Willingness variable made the strongest unique contribution to predicting EBPAS outcomes. One other variable, Shared Professional Responsibility also made a significant unique contribution to the variance in the dependent variable, and none of the remaining four variables approached statistical significance. Conclusions and implications. Taken together, these outcomes form the basis for a better understanding the current environment for integration of mental health… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)","","","","","","Burton, Donna L.","2014","https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/school-mental-health-views-services-integration/docview/1543435994/se-2?accountid=14026","APA PsycInfo (2024)"
"1123","When public radio goes private: The consequences of privatization on the NPR network of stations","This dissertation explores the consequences of the privatization of National Public Radio for the NPR network of stations. In Chapter 1, I introduce the major questions posed by this dissertation and review some of its limitations. In Chapter 2, by analyzing the rates of stations' adoption of NPR membership and departure from the network, this research tests several hypotheses from literature on organizational population ecology, crowding in/out theory, and political composition. The results indicate that after an initial wave of departures from NPR in the wake of privatization, the NPR network of stations has continued to grow. At the same time, greater dependence on federal funding tends to be associated with more stability in the network of stations (fewer adoptions and departures), while business funding increases the rate of departures. These findings suggest that in the privatization era of reduced government funding, the NPR network of stations may operate more like a private marketplace. I also find that the concepts of the liability of newness, density delay, and density dependence while significantly shaping the dynamics of the organizational population's pattern of growth, must be significantly adapted to apply to adoptions and departures rather than organizational foundings and mortalities. Finally, the results suggest that, controlling for levels of government funding for the NPR network, Republican control of at least one house of Congress does little to increase the probability of the departure of any individual station, but were associated with higher rates of departures at the national level. Though further research is needed, this finding may suggest that Republican anti-NPR rhetoric creates unease throughout the system that discourages continued membership for stations. In Chapter 3 and 4, I use two datasets—one from a 1984 internal NPR survey and one from a 1999-2005 Station Resource Group survey—to analyze how privatization of stations may have affected the balance of news and cultural content (Chapter 3) and national and local content (Chapter 4) at NPR stations. These datasets allowed me to test key questions about private funding and market demand in media content as well as broad claims about the death of localism. The findings quite clearly indicate a radical shift in the programming content of NPR stations between the 1980s and the early 2000s. By the 2000s, stations were airing far more news than local content (a reversal from the 1980s) and a somewhat greater proportion of national rather than local content. In Chapter 3, the findings of several analyses of the sample from the 2000s indicate that more privatized stations (i.e., those with a greater dependence on subscriber funds) tend to follow the patterns of market demand, giving listeners the news content they want. By contrast, for various reasons, stations with more funding from the government and business were more able to resist market demand, providing more cultural content. In the pre-privatization sample from 1984, I observed no such patterns. While the findings regarding news and cultural content from Chapter 3 tend to support a market demand theory of privatization, Chapter 4 suggests that market demand effects do not fully extend to the balance of national and local content. In 1984, federal funds had the effect of increasing local programming, supporting one of the stated missions of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. By the 2000s, greater federal and business funds actually increased the proportion of national programming, resisting the observed demand for less national and more local content. On the other hand, increased levels of subscriber funding exerted no affect on the programming content of the stations. This finding suggests that though federal and business funds may affect stations ability to purchase more national programming, NPR stations are not directly … (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","","","","","","Lindner, Andrew M.","2014","https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/when-public-radio-goes-private-consequences/docview/1506425062/se-2?accountid=14026","APA PsycInfo (2024)"

Multiple-group structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses were conducted on a subsample of 911 third-, fourth-, and fifth-graders identified as perpetrators of bullying. They belonged to 77 Finnish schools, including 39 schools implementing the KiVa program and 38 control schools. Data on peer-reported bullying and perceived popularity were collected before program implementation and one year later. Controlling for sex, age, and initial levels of bullying, KiVa participation resulted in lower rates of bullying (indicated by fewer peer nominations) after one year for bullies of low and medium popularity. However, there was no significant effect for those high in popularity, suggesting that popular bullies are less responsive to anti-bullying interventions than less popular bullies.

"1125","Children's intervention strategies in situations of victimization by bullying: Social cognitions of outsiders versus defenders","This study examined the social cognitions of outsiders and defenders about intervening in situations of victimization by bullying. Do outsiders and defenders behave differently in victimization situations because of differences in competence beliefs, or because of a selectivity effect in intervening? These issues were examined in a sample of 102 outsiders and 107 defenders who were classified into these bullying roles through a peer-nomination procedure out of a total sample of 761 10- to 14-year-old Dutch children. These children were presented with imaginary victimization events. They answered questions about their cognitions and self-efficacy beliefs about intervening in victimization situations and about handling such situations. Outsiders, compared to defenders, claimed to intervene indirectly in victimization situations rather than directly. Defenders, compared to outsiders, claimed to intervene directly in victimization situations rather than indirectly. Both outsiders and defenders claimed to be more likely to intervene when a friend was being victimized than when a neutral classmate was being victimized. Outsiders and defenders did not differ in their self-efficacy for indirect intervention, but only defenders claimed a high self-efficacy for direct intervention. Both outsiders and defenders claimed to benefit from direct help when they themselves are victimized, but only outsiders also reported to need indirect help. The results suggest that outsiders and defenders behave differently in victimization situations because of differences in competence beliefs rather than because of a selectivity effect. More generally, the results suggest that not only defenders but also outsiders have the intention to help children who are being bullied. However, outsiders' anti-bullying attempts are likely to be indirect and less firm than those of defenders.

The present study examined the extent to which bully-victims (in comparison to pure bullies and pure victims) are perpetrators and targets of verbal, physical, indirect, and cyber bullying. The sample included 19,869 students from grades 1 to 8 (7 to 15 years of age). Bully-victims (whether identified by self- or peer-reports) perpetrated significantly more physical and verbal bullying than pure bullies. They also tended to score higher than bullies in cyberbullying, but not in indirect bullying. With respect to victimization, bully-victims were more frequent targets of all four forms of victimization than pure victims. The frequent victimization experiences of bully-victims may be one factor contributing to their high maladjustment reported in the literature. Challenges for teacher training and bullying interventions are discussed.

However, this research has not used tasks that require the discrimination of seen from unseen stimuli, an important element of real-world recognition tasks such as eyewitness identification. We tested the idea that children would be less able to monitor and control the accuracy of their memories in such a task. We used a word-pair recognition task to compare children’s (109 8–12 year olds) and adult’s (102 first-year psychology students) ability to adaptively make, monitor, and control the reporting of yes/no recognition decisions about familiar stimuli in a task with no demand effects. We found that adults were substantially better at discriminating old from new stimuli, but no evidence of an age difference in metacognitive ability. Although these results do not explain children’s poor metacognition in eyewitness identification, they suggest potential steps to improve children’s identification performance.

"1129","Neurophysiological responses to schizophrenia-associated communication abnormalities","Background: Individuals with schizophrenia experience difficulty with interpersonal interactions, in part resulting from communication abnormalities that are common in the disorder, and to the expectancy effects from knowledge of the person's diagnosis. The auditory N400 event-related potential provides an objective measure of recognition of incongruent speech and thus is a potential tool to understand how listeners respond to disordered speech as a function of awareness of diagnosis. Methods: In this study, participants listened to segments of conversation between two people in which the sentence final word was a normal ending, a word approximation, or a neologism while EEG was recorded. Participants were randomized to two groups: told that the speaker had a diagnosis of schizophrenia or not told about a diagnosis. Results: Participants who were not told that the speaker had schizophrenia displayed a significant N400 during both word approximations and neologisms. However, no significant N400 was observed for participants who were told that the speaker had schizophrenia. Conclusions: Differential neurological responses to the same abnormal speech depending on whether the diagnosis of the speaker was known, indicate an early processing expectancy effect for abnormal communication to come from someone with schizophrenia. Such responses to abnormal speech in schizophrenia indicate an expectation of abnormality from individuals with schizophrenia, which has implications for understanding social exclusion of individuals with the disorder.

A large data set including 17,625 students from elementary (Grades 3–5) and middle school (Grades 7–8) was utilized to examine the prevalence of students with diverse victimization profiles. A longitudinal subsample of 7,850 students was used to test hypotheses regarding the antecedents and consequences of electronic victimization when occurring in isolation from traditional forms versus accompanied by them. According to the main findings, (a) the victims of electronic bullying were in most cases bullied in traditional ways as well; (b) being a target of electronic-only victimization was not predicted by either intrapersonal (depression) or interpersonal (low social acceptance) risk factors; and (c) electronic victimization, when occurring in isolation from traditional victimization, did not contribute to increases in depression over time. Electronic victimization is rare, and is almost always accompanied by traditional victimization. It leads to increases in depression only when combined with traditional victimization. Rather than shifting attention from traditional to electronic victimization, educators should continue their efforts on reducing victimization in general.

A sample of 1,131 Secondary 1 (mean age = 12 years 7 months) and Secondary 3 (mean age = 14 years 8 months) students in Singapore are given hypothetical situations and norms, judgments, and approval of the participant roles sought. Roles are found to differ in norms, judgments, and approval, with the reporter role judged as rather likely but less likely judged as right or with approval compared to other roles. In addition, participant role and secondary level interact for norms, judgments, and approval. Participant role also interacts with gender for judgments and approval and with bullying type for norms and approval. The reporter role is thus one worth further investigation.

"1132","Cognitive flexibility during breath alcohol plateau is associated with previous drinking measures","Although the biphasic effects of acute alcohol during ascending and descending Breath Alcohol Concentrations (BrACs) are well described, the plateau period between peak and steadily descending BrACs is generally unrecognized and under-studied by researchers. Naturalistic examinations indicate such periods persist for substantial intervals, with a timeframe of onset suggesting BrAC plateaus may co-occur with potentially risky behaviors (e.g., driving). The current pilot study examined neurocognitive performance during this period. Participants were healthy, community-residing moderate drinkers ( n = 18). In the first phase of the study, the Digit Symbol Substitution and Trail Making Tasks were administered during BrAC plateau ( M = 62 mg/dL). BrACs were negatively correlated with Digit Symbol performance but unrelated to other tasks. In contrast, performance on a derived Trail Making measure of set-shifting was positively associated with the maximum alcohol doses consumed in the preceding 6 months. Phase 2 analyses demonstrated that relationships between previous alcohol experience and cognitive performance were absent among individuals receiving placebo beverages. Taken together, these data suggest a relationship worthy of investigation between previous drinking experiences and cognitive flexibility during the plateau phase.

"1133","Monitoring the effects of adult psychotherapy in routine practice in Switzerland: A feasibility trial","Background: Several studies have been published on the effects of psychotherapy in routine practice. Complementing traditional views summarised as ‘dose-effect models’, Stiles et al. put forward data consistent with the responsive regulation model underlining the importance of the client’s active participant role in defining length of treatment. One may ask what level of change reached by a patient is considered to be the ‘good enough level’ (GEL) and if it is related to the duration of psychotherapy. Aims: The main objective of the present feasibility trial was to monitor the patient’s session-by-session evolution using a self-report questionnaire in order to define the GEL, i.e. the number of sessions necessary for the patient to reach significant change. Method: A total of N = 13 patients undergoing psychotherapy in routine practice participated in the study, completing the Outcome Questionnaire—45.2 (OQ-45), which assesses the symptom level, interpersonal relationships and social role after every psychotherapy session. The data was analysed using multi-level analyses (HLMs). Results: High feasibility of fine-grained assessment of effects of psychotherapy in routine practice in Switzerland was shown; response rates being acceptable; however, detailed analysis of the GEL was not feasible within the short study time-frame. Conclusions: Reflections on the political context of monitoring in the specific case of routine psychiatric practice in Switzerland are discussed.

In the first investigation of this (Schnall, Zadra, &amp; Proffitt, 2010), it was shown that people with low blood sugar gave higher estimates of slanted surfaces than people with normal blood sugar. The question that arises is whether these higher estimates are due to lower blood sugar, per se, or experimental demand created by other aspects of the experiment. Here evidence was collected from 120 observers showing that directly manipulating physiological potential, while controlling for experimental demand effects, does not alter the perception of slant. Indeed, when experimental demand went against behavioral potential, it produced judgmental biases opposite to those predicted by behavioral potential in the low blood sugar condition. It is suggested that low blood sugar only affects slant judgments by making participants more susceptible to judgmental biases.

"1135","The effect of joke-origin-induced expectancy on cognitive humor","Four experiments explored the effect of humor expectancy on the cognitive evaluation of jokes. Participants read jokes purportedly delivered by celebrity comedians or celebrity non-comedians. Participants reported jokes in the comedian condition to be significantly more amusing (Experiment 1). Furthermore, this effect was repeated in a within-participants replication where celebrity comedians and celebrity non-comedians were matched on positive evaluations (Experiment 2). This indicates that the findings cannot be explained via differential positive attitudes towards the celebrities in each condition. In Experiment 3, different types of jokes (incongruency/nonsensical) and humor levels (high/low) were compared. The expectancy effect was found to be more pronounced for nonsensical jokes. This was argued to be due to nonsensical jokes being more uniquely associated with comedians, whereas the ubiquity of incongruency jokes dilutes any effect of expectancy. However, Experiment 4 demonstrated that the expectancy effect is contingent on the name of the comedian being observed. In summary, it is argued that prior exposure to the named comedian primes an expectancy of forthcoming humor; this expectancy influences humor ratings. These findings are consistent with Wimer and Beins (2008), who showed that priming humor expectations through joke ratings can influence cognitive humor. The current study may explain why new comics need to “win over the audience” whereas established comedians can rely upon the expectation of humor derived from past exposures.

The Grades 1–3 students were located in 74 schools and Grades 7–9 students in 73 schools that were randomly assigned to intervention and control conditions. Multilevel regression analyses revealed that after 9 months of implementation, the intervention had beneficial effects in Grades 1–3 on self-reported victimization and bullying (odds ratios ˜ 1.5), with some differential effects by gender. In Grades 7–9, statistically significant positive results were obtained on 5 of 7 criterion variables, but results often depended on gender and sometimes age. The effects were largest for boys' peer reports: bullying, assisting the bully, and reinforcing the bully (Cohen's ds 0.11–0.19). Overall, the findings from the present study and from a previous study for Grades 4–6 (Kärnä, Voeten, Little, Poskiparta, Kaljonen, et al., 2011) indicate that the KiVa program is effective in reducing bullying and victimization in Grades 1–6, but the results are more mixed in Grades 7–9.

"1137","Social context of bullying: Do misperceptions of group norms influence children's responses to witnessed episodes?","This study explores the association between norm misperception and behavioral responses to witnessed bullying episodes. We hypothesized that pluralistic ignorance (PI) could explain individual differences in behavioral responses. According to PI theory, children who believe that victims deserve protection may inhibit defending behavior if they assume their attitudes are out of step with their peers. A total of 446 fourth and eighth graders described their personal attitudes and perceptions of peers’ attitudes about bullying, as well as their behavioral responses when they witnessed a bullying episode. Consistent with PI theory, children perceived their personal attitudes as more prosocial than those of their classmates. Further, misperception of group norms was associated with children’s reports of behavioral responses to bullying; children who overestimated peers’ approval of bullying reported lower levels of defending the victim and higher levels of joining in.

"1138","The speakers’ accent shapes the listeners’ phonological predictions during speech perception","This study investigates the specificity of predictive coding in spoken word comprehension using event-related potentials (ERPs). We measured word-evoked ERPs in Catalan speakers listening to semantically constraining sentences produced in their native regional accent (Experiment 1) or in a non-native accent (Experiment 2). Semantically anomalous words produced long-lasting negative shift (N400) starting as early as 250 ms, thus reflecting phonological as well as semantic mismatch. Semantically expected but phonologically unexpected (non-native forms embedded in a native context) produced only an early (~ 250 ms) negative difference. In contrast, this phonological expectancy effect failed for native albeit phonologically unexpected target words embedded in a non-native context. These results suggest phonologically precise expectations when operating over native input, whilst phonologically less specified expectations in a non-native context. Our findings shed light on contextual influence during word recognition, suggesting that word form prediction based on context is sensitive and adaptive to phonological variability.

"1139","Lay definitions of violence among Swedish children, teenagers, and adults","Definitions of violence vary and are almost always operationalized by the researcher. Perceptions of violence often determine levels of tolerance of violence. Little research has focused on lay definitions. A total of 309 Swedes (78 children, 85 teenagers, 99 younger adults, and 47 adults (30+); 48% male) were interviewed using a specially developed interview protocol. Content analysis was used to assign definitional categories. A folk taxonomy emerged. Immediate physical violence accounted for 73% of all assigned categories. Hit was the word that occurred most frequently. If global physical violence was included, physical violence accounted for 89% of 780 assigned categories. Immediate non-physical violence accounted for 9% and vicarious violence (including media violence) accounted for 2%. Distributions of categories by respondents’ gender, age, and participant role in incidents of violence showed the underlying definitions of violence to be extremely stable. The conclusion is that ordinary Swedes share a robust lay definition of violence as a behavior that is immediate, done in close quarters, and physical.

"1141","Manufacturer product line decisions in growing consumer technology markets: A case of digital cameras","The objective of this dissertation is to deepen our understanding of competitive and demand drivers of manufacturer new product introductions in consumer technology markets. Researchers in economics and marketing commonly view differentiated products as combinations of ""attributes"" that are located in multi-attribute space. In first study presented in Chapter 2 of this dissertation, I conform to this common view of products as multi-attribute bundles and, therefore, carefully construct both a multi-attribute product space, as well as, and even more importantly, product clusters within this multi-attribute product space. I focus on the early stages of US Digital Cameras category (1998-2000). Operationalizing and classifying all existing products in the category, as well as each new product introduction (when it occurs), on a common space of objective product attributes allows us to (1) explicitly understand whether a given introduction is an incremental innovation or a radical innovation, and (2) whether it is an introduction in to a cluster where the firm already has a strong presence or not etc. Further, it allows us to understand whether the new product introduction decisions of a firm are influenced by relative cluster characteristics which, in turn, are influenced by competitors' new product introductions in the different clusters etc. In the Chapter 2 of this dissertation I focus on two specific new product introduction decisions of digital camera manufacturers: timing and positioning. Additional insights are obtained from empirically estimating a pricing model using the same product cluster conceptual framework. In Chapter 3, I study new product preannouncements, which have become commonplace in manufacturers product strategy in consumer technology markets. Here I undertake a detailed empirical analysis of the demand effects of product preannouncements within the digital cameras category. I estimate a new product adoption model using monthly data on product-level availability, sales and prices across hundreds of digital cameras that were introduced over a period of 4 years. I study the effects of the incidence and timing of a product preannouncement on demand for the preannounced product (i.e., digital camera model), as well as demand for its competitors. In doing this, I implicitly accommodate the impact of product preannouncements for individual products on category-level demand growth. Using a detailed model-based accounting of preannouncement effects, I separate the effects of a preannouncement on (1) innovation and word-of-mouth components underlying demand for the preannounced product, and (2) consumer preferences for preannounced product attributes. I demonstrate the managerial implications of the estimated preannouncement effects using a numerical experiment.

"1142","When is semantic priming automatic? Instrument and location participant role priming as a case study","Recently, semantic priming has been used to argue for a close semantic relationship between verbs and their typical participant role fillers (Ferretti, et al., 2001; McRae, et al., 2005). This suggests that verbs automatically provide more situational knowledge than is typically assumed in many linguistic frameworks (see Elman, 2009 for discussion). Moreover, it would provide a mechanism for how some linguistic and real-world knowledge can be rapidly coordinated to immediately guide on-line language parsing and interpretation. However, it has yet to be conclusively demonstrated that the semantic priming results reported by Ferretti et al. are due to automatic activation. They may instead be due to strategic processes. In this study, I attempt to answer three questions. First, was the instrument priming effect observed by Ferretti et al. and in Experiment 1 of this dissertation (which was a direct replication of Ferretti et al.'s instrument priming study) the consequence of automatic activation of typical instrument role fillers by instrument verbs? The results of Experiments 2-3, which employed experimental paradigms that are argued to be immune to strategic influences, suggest that Ferretti et al.'s instrument priming effects was not due to automatic activation of typical instrument role fillers by instrument verbs. The second question is: Was the instrument priming effect observed by Ferretti et al. and in the replication (Experiment 1) influenced by strategic processes? The results of Experiments 4a-c, which employed baseline primes that were unlikely to contribute to any instrument expectation strategy, all showed that the magnitude of instrument priming obtained in Experiment 1, was significantly reduced when unrelated instrument verb primes that contributed to strategy formation were replaced with more neutral primes. These results clearly indicate that the instrument priming effect observed by Ferretti et al. was not due to automatic processes, but instead was due to the use of two response strategies that were promoted by the confluence of task and materials variables. The results of Experiments 5a-b and Experiment 6 provide evidence for this claim. The results reported on in this dissertation are important theoretically because they undermine the representational and processing claims of one widely-cited view of verb participant role information, namely the verb-specific concepts theory (e.g., Ferretti, et al., 2001). According to the verb-specific concepts view, verbs and their typical participant role fillers overlap in representations, and hence recognition of verbs should automatically activate their typical participant role fillers, and vice versa. Because this view has been used to support sentence processing theories (e.g., Elman, 2009), the results reported in this dissertation have implications for both the organization of lexical semantic representations and sentence processing. Additionally, the experiments in this dissertation make a number of methodological contributions. Among these contributions is that they provide a direct comparison of three types of neutral baseline for semantic priming studies. The results of the neutral baseline experiments show that these three baselines are roughly comparable. These experiments also delineate a set of factors commonly present in semantic priming studies that promote the development and use of response strategies.

"1143","School professionals' experiences with obese high school students","Adolescent obesity has become endemic. Despite the consequences of adolescent obesity, which include high blood pressure, low self-esteem, and Type II diabetes, educational effects, including teacher experiences with obese students, remain undetermined. The purpose of this case study was to explore and better understand school professionals' experiences with obese students. The conceptual frameworks that guided this study were the notions of the self-fulfilling prophecy, Pygmalion effect, and teacher expectancy effect. The research question explored the experiences of these school professionals with obese high school students. Data were collected through interviews with teachers, counselors, and administrators and analyzed using open, axial, and selective coding. Seven themes emerged: (a) lack of support for obese students, (b) inconsistent understanding of student interactions, (c) positive school professional relationships with obese students, (d) lack of health and nutrition education for students, (e) perceptions of cultural differences amongst obese students, (f) lack of educator training on obese students, and (g) health concerns for obese students. Recommendations include assisting teachers in understanding that their perceptions may have a direct impact on student achievement, implementing activities to combat low expectations of students, and staff development opportunities and sensitivity training that focus on understanding adolescent obesity. Implications for social change include enhanced understanding of the experiences of school professionals with obese students, which may lead to professional development opportunities and future interventions aimed at improving the academic success of obese students.

"1145","„Gewalt ist keine Lösung, aber eine coole Alternative?""—Was Täter bei Bullying so erfolgreich macht","Those, who bully others, are prone to be characterized as ""aggressive"", ""antisocial"", and ""with-out empathy"" by their teachers: the standard view on aggressive children. However, are these qualities a bully could gain dominance from? With this study we aim to examine the characteristics of ""effective"" bullies. To this end, we gathered sociometric data on participant roles (Salmivalli, Lagerspetz, Björkqvist, Östermann, Kaukiainen, 1996), resource-control strategies (Hawley, 2003) and social status (Coie, Dodge, Coppotelli, 1982; Cillessen u. Mayeux, 2004) from 2,600 pupils (54% male), first to tenth grade in primary and secondary schools in and around Munich. Bullies in primary school extensively used coercive strategies, while those who bully individual peers in secondary school combined the extensive use of coercive strategies with a comparable amount of prosocial strategies. In consequence, they control most of the material and social resources in the classroom. When bistrategics were compared with those, who only use coercive strategies, the two groups differed in resource control as well as in status. Bullies identified as bistrategics were high on perceived popularity, but that is—other than in primary school—attributed to the coercives in secondary school, too. Implications on how to recognize an effective bully are discussed in order to make sure that victims receive effective support.

"1146","Double-blind lineup administration: Effects of administrator knowledge on eyewitness decisions","Over 100 years ago, the horse Clever Hans captivated the public’s attention with his apparent ability to provide correct numerical answers to mathematical questions. If the answer to the question was five, Hans tapped his hoof five times to indicate the correct answer. The psychologist Oskar Pfungst (1911/1965) examined this phenomenon and discovered that Hans could no longer answer the questions accurately when the questioner stood farther away from him, when the questioner was blocked from his view, or when the questioner did not know the correct answer to the question. Hans’s accuracy depended on having a clear, close view of the person with the right answer. Upon this discovery, Pfungst shifted his focus from studying the horse to studying the people who questioned the horse and observed that the questioners involuntarily and unknowingly changed postures and facial expressions when Hans had provided the correct number of taps. Indeed, the questioners provided the correct answer to Hans through subtle nonverbal cues. Thus, Hans’s cleverness became the first documented evidence of an interpersonal expectancy effect. Do interpersonal expectancies operate in other legal settings, including those in which police officers administer lineups or photo arrays to eyewitnesses? When administrators show witnesses a lineup or an array of photos, they typically have a hypothesis that one of the lineup members is or one of the photos depicts the perpetrator of a crime. Do police officers communicate their hypotheses—consciously or unconsciously—to witnesses through their behavior? If so, do these behaviors influence witnesses to identify the suspect more frequently than they would if the police administrator did not know which lineup member was the suspect? To examine these questions, we review psychological research on expectancy effects more generally and then discuss evidence for the operation of interpersonal expectancies in legal settings, including lineup administrations.

"1148","“Did I do as best as the system would let me?” Healthcare professional views on hospital to home care transitions","Background: Patients are vulnerable to poor quality, fragmented care as they transition from hospital to home. Few studies examine the discharge process from the perspectives of multiple healthcare professionals. Objective: To understand care transitions from the perspective of diverse healthcare professionals, and identify recommendations for process improvement. Design: Cross sectional qualitative study. Participants and Setting: Clinicians, care teams, and administrators from the inpatient general medicine services at one urban, academic hospital; two outpatient primary care clinics; and one Medicaid managed care plan. Approach: We conducted 13 focus groups and two in-depth interviews with participants prior to initiating a hospital-funded, multi-component transitional care intervention for uninsured and low-income publicly insured patients, the Care Transitions Innovation (C-TraIn). We used thematic analysis to identify emergent themes and a cross-case comparative analysis to describe variation by participant role and setting. Key Results: Poor transitional care reflected healthcare system fragmentation, limiting the ability of healthcare professionals to provide optimal patient care. Lack of standardized processes, poor multidisciplinary communication within the hospital, and fragmented communication across settings led to chaotic, unsystematic transitions, poor patient outcomes, and feelings of futility and dissatisfaction among providers. Patients with complex psychosocial needs were especially vulnerable during care transitions. Recommended changes to improve transitional care included improving hospital multidisciplinary hospital rounds, clarifying accountability as patients move across settings, standardizing discharge processes, and providing additional medical staff training. Conclusions: Hospital to home care transitions are critical junctures that can impact health outcomes, experience of care, and costs. Transitional care quality improvement initiatives must address system fragmentation, reduce communication barriers within and between settings, and ensure adequate professional training.

"1149","The visible hand? Demand effects of recommendation networks in electronic markets","Online commercial interactions have increased dramatically over the last decade, leading to the emergence of networks that link the electronic commerce landing pages of related products to one another. Our paper conjectures that the explicit visibility of such “product networks”can alter demand spillovers across their constituent items. We test this conjecture empirically using data about the copurchase networks and demand levels associated with more than 250,000 interconnected books offered on Amazon.com over the period of one year while controlling for alternative explanations of demand correlation using a variety of approaches. Our findings suggest that on average the explicit visibility of a copurchase relationship can lead to up to an average threefold amplification of the influence that complementary products have on each others’ demand levels. We also find that newer and more popular products “use” the attention they garner from their network position more efficiently and that diversity in the sources of spillover further amplifies the demand effects of the recommendation network. Our paper presents new evidence quantifying the role of network position in electronic markets and highlights the power of basing (virtual) shelf position on consumer preferences that are explicitly revealed through shared purchasing patterns.

We proposed that beyond the effect of self-efficacy, the decision to defend the victim of bullying vs. remain passive vs. reinforce the bully depends on outcomes children expect from defending, and on the value they place on these outcomes. Our sample consisted of 6397 Finnish children (3232 girls and 3165 boys) from third, fourth, and fifth grades (mean ages 9–11 years). Results showed that the motivational underpinnings of defending the victim, remaining passive, and reinforcing the bully varied. Defending was associated with the expectation that the victim feels better as a result of defending as well as valuing such an outcome. Reinforcement of bullying was associated with negative expectations and not caring about the positive outcomes. Conflicting expectations and values were linked to remaining passive. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for anti-bullying interventions.

"1152","Validating a behavioral economic approach to assess food demand: Effects of body mass index, dietary restraint, and impulsivity","Behavioral economic theory is a useful framework for analyzing factors influencing choice, but the majority of human behavioral economic research has focused on drug choice. The behavioral economic choice paradigm may also be valuable for understanding food-maintained behavior. Our primary objective was two-fold: (1) Validate a human laboratory model of food-appetitive behavior, and (2) Assess the contribution of individual level factors that may differentially impact food choice behavior. Two studies were conducted. In Study 1, female subjects ( N = 17) participated in two consecutive food choice experimental sessions, whereas in Study 2, female subjects ( N = 21) participated in one concurrent food choice experimental session. During consecutive choice sessions (Study 1), demand for the more palatable food (i.e., high-sugar/high-fat) was more inelastic than the less palatable (i.e., low-sugar/low-fat) option. During concurrent choice sessions, demand for the more palatable food (i.e., high-sugar/high-fat) was more inelastic for restrained vs. unrestrained eaters, and for those who were overweight vs. normal weight. Demand for both palatable and less palatable choices was more elastic for high-impulsive vs. low-impulsive subjects. These findings suggest that the behavioral economic framework can be used successfully to develop a human laboratory model of food-appetitive behavior.

"1153","Do watching eyes affect charitable giving? Evidence from a field experiment","The presence of implicit observation cues, such as picture of eyes, has been shown to increase generosity in dictator games, and cooperative behavior in field settings. I combine these approaches, by testing if a picture of watching eyes affects unconditional giving in a natural environment, where the recipient is a charity organization. Taken together, this study reduces the influence of three potential confounding factors in previous experiments: (i) experimenter demand effects, (ii) that the facial cue reminds subjects of a human counterpart, and (iii) a social multiplier effect. Specifically, the paper reports results from an experiment, conducted in a Swedish supermarket chain, where customers face a naturally occurring decision problem. People who recycle cans and bottles have to choose whether to keep the recycled amount or donate it to a charity organization. By posting a picture of human eyes on recycling machines, I am able to test whether this causes an increase in donations to the charity. Based on a sample covering a 12-day period, 38 stores and 16775 individual choices, I find no general effect. However, when controlling for store and day fixed effects, and using a proxy for store attendance, the picture of eyes increased donated amount by 30 percent during days when relatively few other people visited the store. This result gives further support to the conclusion that subtle social cues can invoke reputation concerns in humans, although the relatively small effect suggests that previous estimates could be biased upward, or at least that the influence of observational cues is context dependent.

"1154","Individual and class moral disengagement in bullying among elementary school children","A cross-sectional study from a sample of 663 elementary school children assessed the four sets of moral disengagement mechanisms conceptualized by Bandura (i.e., cognitive restructuring, minimizing one's agentive role, disregarding/distorting the consequences, blaming/dehumanizing the victim) at both the individual and the class level. Additionally, an analysis of the relations of these mechanisms to pro-bullying behavior was conducted. Multilevel analysis showed a significant relationship between cognitive restructuring and individual pro-bullying behavior. Moreover, between-class variability of pro-bullying behavior was positively related to minimizing one's agentive role and blaming/dehumanizing the victim at the class level. Conversely, class disregarding/distorting the consequences was negatively associated with between-class variation in the outcome behavior. Implications for understanding the role of morality in children's bullying are discussed.

In Study 1, an apology offered to a male participant (role-playing a victim) by an attractive female offender was more effective at increasing forgiveness compared to the same apology offered by a less attractive offender. In contrast, female participants displayed the opposite pattern, responding more positively to the less attractive offender. Study 2 revealed that this effect was mediated by participants’ judgments about the quality of the apology received. Male participants judged the apology as higher in quality when it was offered by the attractive offender, whereas female participants rated the apology as higher quality when it was offered by the less attractive offender.

"1156","Moral disengagement and emotional and social difficulties in bullying and cyberbullying: Differences by participant role","Participant roles in traditional bullying have been well researched, and the social and emotional characteristics identified with each role are clearly documented. However, little is known about the participant roles in cyberbullying and the degree to which these correspond to traditional bullying roles. This study aims to investigate similarities and differences between participant roles in traditional bullying and cyberbullying, in terms of moral disengagement and social and emotional characteristics. In total, 517 German students in grades 5–10 were assessed for bullying involvement using the Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) method. Cyberbullying was slightly less frequent than traditional bullying, although there was considerable overlap, with many students involved in cyberbullying also participating in traditional bullying. More cyberbullies had a bad conscience compared to traditional bullies, hence students involved in cyberbullying showed greater moral disengagement. High school satisfaction emerged as a protective factor for nearly all roles, while feeling lonely, feeling unpopular and being friendless appeared as risk factors for (cyber)victimisation. The enhancement of empathy by (cyber)bullies and (cyber)assistants for their targets, and the development of a positive school culture, are proposed as key aspects for both anti-bullying and anti-cyberbullying prevention and intervention.

"1157","Cross-category demand effects of price promotions","Do promotions in a certain category lead to higher revenues in other categories? If so, to what degree? The answers to these questions are highly relevant for retailers that supply products in different categories. Empirical findings in studies that consider a limited number of categories indicate small promotional cross-category effects. This study develops a framework to determine the impact of price promotions on category revenues that include interdependencies among a substantial number of categories at the category demand level. The own- and cross-category demand effects are moderated by variables such as promotion intensity, category characteristics (own-category effects), and spatial distances between shelf locations (cross-category effects). The empirical results based on daily store-level scanner data show that approximately half of all price promotions expand own-category revenues, especially for categories with deeper supported discounts. There is a high probability (61%) that a price promotion affects sales of at least one other category. The number of categories affected is not greater than two. Moderate evidence supports the existence of cross-promotional effects between categories more closely located in a store.

"1158","Sex differences in stimulus expectancy and pharmacologic effects of a moderate dose of alcohol on smoking lapse risk in a laboratory analogue study","Rationale: Alcohol use is often implicated in initial lapses to smoking during quit smoking attempts. Mechanisms explaining this association are unknown but could include (a) learned associations between drinking and smoking or (b) direct pharmacologic effects of alcohol. Objectives: In a 2 (told alcohol vs. told placebo) × 2 (0.4 g/kg vs. 0.0 g/kg ethanol) between-subjects balanced placebo design, we examined instruction and beverage condition effects on smokers’ ability to resist initiating smoking and whether these effects differed by sex. Methods: Participants were 96 heavy alcohol drinkers, smoking 10–30 cigarettes per day. After 15 h of smoking abstinence, participants consumed either an alcoholic or a nonalcoholic beverage and 35 min later completed a smoking lapse task. Results: Overall, neither instructions nor beverage contents influenced behavior on the smoking lapse task. However, the instruction condition had different effects in men and women. Women, but not men, were more likely to smoke and reported expecting greater satisfaction from smoking when they were told alcohol compared to told placebo. The effects of instruction condition on smoking behavior were not mediated by self-reported expected satisfaction from smoking. Conclusions: Women may be more likely to choose to smoke after drinking moderate amounts of alcohol because of their expectations rather than the pharmacological effects of the alcohol.

"1159","A mediated moderation model of conformative peer bullying","We investigated the relationship between conformative peer bullying and issues of peer conformity among adolescents. This relationship is examined through the establishment of a mediated moderation model for conformative peer bullying using structural equation modeling in a sample of 391 second-year middle school students in Seoul, South Korea. We found that peer pressure and resistance to peer influence interact with one another to affect antisocial conformity, which then affects conformative peer bullying, thereby establishing its mediated moderation effect. The results suggest that conformative peer bullying that encourages and assists active bullies is affected by antisocial conformity; moreover, an individual’s capacity to resist peer influence plays a protective role against peer conformity, and this must be acknowledged as a significant influence in conformative peer bullying among adolescents.

As a test vehicle we use the well-known endowment effect. Even though our goods are entirely virtual, our results confirm earlier results that individuals with more trading experience are less likely to exhibit status quo behaviour in trade. However, we also find evidence that highly experienced individuals are more likely to swap the item rather than keep it—i.e. there appears to be a propensity to ‘truck, barter and exchange’. A further experiment suggests that this feature is robust and is unlikely to be due to subject misperception or experimenter demand effects. However we are unable to eliminate selection effects as the source of our correlation between experience and propensity to trade. We conclude that virtual economies may be useful venues for field experiments.

"1161","Anticipated feelings of guilt and shame as predictors of early adolescents' antisocial and prosocial interpersonal behaviour","The primary aim of this study was to examine how early adolescents’ anticipated guilt and shame before adults in response to wrong doing are related to each other and to their antisocial and prosocial behaviour. Measures of anticipated guilt and shame before adults were obtained from 363 10- to 13- year-old participants. Correlational analyses were used to relate participants’ anticipated guilt and shame before adults to their teacher-reported aggressive behaviour, to a peer-report-based measure of antisocial behaviour that combined nomination-based measures of bullying, aggression, and unempathic behaviour, and to a peer-report-based measure of prosocial behaviour that combined nomination-based measures of helping victims of bullying and of empathic behaviour. For exploratory reasons, anticipated guilt and shame before adults were also related to a peer-nomination-based measure of participants’ outsider behaviour, that is their tendency to actively avoid all involvement in bullying. Results indicated that there was a considerable positive relation between anticipated guilt and shame before adults and that both types of anticipated affective responses were negatively related to antisocial behaviour and positively to prosocial and outsider behaviour. However, when guilt and shame before adults were controlled for each other using regression analyses, only guilt was positively related to prosocial (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)","","","","","","Olthof, Tjeert","2012","https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/anticipated-feelings-guilt-shame-as-predictors/docview/1020053517/se-2?accountid=14026","APA PsycInfo (2024)"

Associations between interpersonal goals, popularity, and bullying in middle childhood and early adolescence","This study investigated whether perceived popularity mediates and/or moderates the association between agentic goals and bullying, and whether sociometric popularity mediates and/or moderates the association between communal goals and bullying. Age and gender differences were also examined. Participants were 276 fourth and fifth graders (middle childhood sample) and 196 seventh and eighth graders (early adolescence sample). Peer status and bullying were assessed with sociometric measures, interpersonal goals with self-reports. The theoretical model included both mediation and moderation effects. An age-related reversal was found in how status mediated the associations between goals and bullying. Sociometric popularity mediated the association of agentic goals with bullying in middle childhood but of communal goals with bullying in early adolescence. Perceived popularity mediated the association of communal goals with bullying in middle childhood but of agentic goals with bullying in early adolescence. In middle childhood, perceived popularity also moderated the effect of agentic goals on bullying. The results were discussed in terms of the role of bullying as a means to enhance status in early adolescence.

"1163","Cyberbullying and traditional bullying in relation to adolescents' perception of parenting","This study investigates the relation between parenting and involvement in cyberbullying. We predicted that cyberbullies and cyberbully-victims report less responsiveness and demanding reactions from their parents than victims and youths who are not involved in cyberbullying. Furthermore, we predicted that youths with neglectful parents cyberbully the most often and youths with authoritative parents cyberbully the least. The same differences were predicted for traditional bullying behavior and for youth involved in both forms of bullying behavior. Participants were made up of 1,200 youths from 10-14 years old. They responded to a survey measuring cyberbullying and traditional bullying with questions based on the sub-scales from the Bully/Victim Questionnaire, and parenting with an adjusted version of the Parenting Style Questionnaire. Most results confirm our predictions. Results on authoritative, authoritarian, permissive and neglectful parenting styles suggest that for bullies, demanding actions are an important dimension of their behavior and for victims, responsiveness is an important dimension of their behavior.

"1164","The role of left inferior frontal gyrus in explicit and implicit semantic processing","Using event-related functional MRI, we examined the involvement of the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) in explicit and implicit semantic processing of Chinese sentences. During scanning, Chinese readers read individually presented normal sentences with a contextually expected or unexpected target noun and were asked to perform an explicit or implicit semantic task (semantic or syntactic violation judgment). The conjunction analysis of the two tasks revealed LIFG as the critical brain region for semantic integration. Further, a cross-task comparison showed more extensive activations for the expectancy effect in the explicit task than in the implicit task in regions including bilateral anterior cingulate cortex/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left middle temporal gyrus, and right inferior frontal gyrus. These results indicate that LIFG is responsible for the integration process per se and that other brain regions observed in previous studies using explicit semantic tasks may be due to task-induced generic processes (e.g., cognitive control).

"1165","Application of preventive strategies","The primary goal of this chapter is to discuss issues surrounding preventive strategies to reduce social desirability, impression management, and faking in applied assessment settings (e.g., personnel screening and selection). In doing so, we draw upon past research that has critically evaluated these techniques in laboratory as well as applied settings. Laboratory research is helpful in identifying techniques that do not work in identifying and preventing faking. After all, if a proposed strategy cannot identify individuals who are known to fake (because they have been instructed to do so), how should we identify those who may be more subtle in their impression management? Stated in another way, laboratory-based research can establish whether a faking detection or control strategy can produce a desired effect. However, such research cannot establish the magnitudes of such effects in real-world applications. Several scholars (e.g., McDaniel &amp; Timm, 1990) have noted that the motivations of experimental participants to comply with experimenter requests differ from the motivations of job applicants undertaking psychological assessments as part of a personnel selection process—that is, laboratory-based experimental demand effects to fake do not approximate applicant or employee response patterns on noncognitive assessments in high-stakes testing situations (see also the discussion of the work of McDaniel and Timm by Vasilopoulos, Reilly, &amp; Leaman, 2000). Thus, research in and information from applied settings provide the gold standard by which to evaluate the various strategies aimed at preventing faking. Unfortunately, as this chapter will show, such research in applied settings continues to be scant. Where it exists, it is limited to certain methods and points of view, and thus many of our judgments regarding the actual effectiveness of such strategies have to rely on information triangulated from laboratory experiments, applied settings, and survey studies, supplemented by our own applied experience. In addition to providing a summary of issues relating to the application of various techniques, we will attempt to provide an overview of their prevalence in real-world testing situations. The quality of the empirical evidence on the actual prevalence of these strategies differs. Even for tools that have been developed several decades ago, no good quantitative estimates may be available. Where possible, we base this overview on survey data, and supplement it with our own experience as practicing psychologists who have encountered organizations and test users employing such approaches.

"1166","Memory conformity: Actors and bystanders","This dissertation explored memory conformity effects on people who interacted with a confederate and of bystanders to that interaction. Two studies were carried out. Study 1 was conducted in the field. A male confederate approached a group of people at the beach and had a brief interaction. About a minute later a research assistant approached the group and administered a target-absent lineup to each person in the group. Analyses revealed that memory conformity occurred during the lineup task. Bystanders were twice as likely to conform as those who interacted with the confederate. Study 2 was carried out in a laboratory under controlled conditions. Participants were exposed to two events during their time in the laboratory. In one event, participants were shown a brief video with no determinate roles assigned. In the other event participants were randomly assigned to interact with a confederate (actor condition) or to witness that interaction (bystander condition). Participants were given memory tests on both events to understand the effects of participant role (actor vs. bystander) on memory conformity. Participants answered second to all questions, following a confederate acting as a participant, who disseminated misinformation on critical questions. Analyses revealed no significant differences in memory conformity between actors and bystanders during the movie memory task. However, differences were found for the interaction memory task such that bystanders conformed more than actors on two of four critical questions. Bystanders also conformed more than actors during a lineup identification task. The results of these studies suggest that the role a person plays in an interaction affects how susceptible they are to information from a co-witness. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed. First, the results are explained through the use of two models of memory. Second, recommendations are made for forensic investigators.

"1167","Effects of monetary incentives on task switching","In two experiments, effects of incentives on task switching were investigated. Incentives were provided as a monetary bonus. In both experiments, the availability of a bonus varied on a trial-to-trial basis. The main difference between the experiments relates to the association of incentives to individual tasks. In Experiment 1, the association of incentives to individual tasks was fixed. Under these conditions, the effect of incentives was largely due to reward expectancy. Switch costs were reduced to statistical insignificance. This was true even with the task that was not associated with a bonus. In Experiment 2, there was a variable association of incentives to individual tasks. Under these conditions, the reward expectancy effect was bound to conditions with a well-established bonus-task association. In conditions in which the bonus-task association was not established in advance, enhanced performance of the bonus task was accompanied by performance decrements with the task that was not associated with a bonus. Reward expectancy affected mainly the general level of performance. The outcome of this study may also inform recently suggested neurobiological accounts about the temporal dynamics of reward processing.

"1168","Psychosocial safety climate: Conceptual distinctiveness and effect on job demands and worker psychological health","Psychosocial safety climate is an emerging construct that refers to shared perceptions regarding policies, practices, and procedures for the protection of worker psychological health and safety. The purpose of the research was to: (1) demonstrate that psychosocial safety climate is a construct distinct from related climate measures (i.e., physical safety climate, team psychological safety, and perceived organizational support); and (2) test the proposition that organizational psychosocial safety climate determines work conditions (i.e., job demands) and subsequently worker psychological health. We used samples from two different cultures; an Australian sample ( N = 126 workers in 16 teams within a primary health care organization) and a Malaysian sample ( N = 180 workers in 31 teams from different organizations and diverse industries). In both samples confirmatory factor analysis verified that psychosocial safety climate is a construct distinct from related climate measures. Using hierarchical linear modeling, psychosocial safety climate was superior to other team level climate measures in its negative relationship to both job demands and psychological health problems. Results supported a mediation process, psychosocial safety climate <U+2192> job demands <U+2192> psychological health problems, corroborating psychosocial safety climate as a preeminent stress risk factor, and an efficient target for intervention. We found both physical and psychosocial safety climates were stronger in the Australian, compared with the Malaysian work context. Levels of psychosocial safety climate were significantly lower than those of physical safety climate in both countries indicating a ‘universal’ lack of attention to workplace psychological health.

"1169","Gender differences in the assessment, stability, and correlates to bullying roles in middle school children","The current study investigated bullying behaviors in 284 school children in the fourth through seventh grades at the time of the initial assessment. Peer ratings of bullying behavior were obtained at the end of the spring semester of one school year and at the end of the fall semester of the next school year. Importantly, peer ratings were obtained by assessing not only the level at which participants actually bully other students but also whether participants help bullies to hurt the victim (assister), encourage bullies (reinforce), or help the victim of bullying (defender). Our results did not support the utility of differentiating between bullies, assisters, or reinforcers. Specifically, these bullying roles were highly intercorrelated, both concurrently and across school years, and they showed similar correlations with aggression and several characteristics often associated with aggression (i.e., conduct problems, callous-unemotional traits, and positive expectancies about aggression). In contrast, ratings of defending designated a particularly prosocial group of students. Finally, whereas bullying appeared to be very similar in boys and girls, it was somewhat more stable across school years and was related to lower levels of prosocial behavior in boys, both of which could suggest that bullying may be somewhat more related to social group dynamics in girls.

"1171","Acute nicotine enhances strategy-based semantic processing in Parkinson's disease","Nicotinic mechanisms may play a role in the cognitive deficits of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, on a cognitively demanding strategy-based priming task, nicotine selectively affected controlled semantic processing in young adult non-smokers as reported by Holmes et al. (International journal of Nenropsychapharmacology 11, 389-399, 2008). Such controlled semantic processing is compromised in PD. This study investigated the effects of acute transdermal nicotine on controlled semantic processing in non-smokers with PD ( n = 10) and non-smoking matched controls ( n = 16) using a strategy-based semantic priming paradigm. Transdermal nicotine patches (7 mg/24 h) were administered in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Participants were instructed to expect target words from specified semantic categories based on the primes, while unexpected targets were also presented. Priming conditions included those concurring with trained expectations (expected-related and expected-unrelated), those which did not (unexpected-related and unexpected-unrelated), and neutral-baseline conditions. Controls evidenced significant expectancy effects (i.e. reaction-time differences for expected vs . unexpected conditions) under both drug states. An expectancy effect was not evident for PD under placebo due to a lack of reaction-time slowing for unexpected conditions. However, under nicotine an expectancy effect was present for PD at a level comparable to controls. Overall the findings indicate that nicotine can improve impaired controlled semantic processing in PD possibly via enhanced expectancy or inhibitory mechanisms.

However, few studies both isolate music as the active ingredient in mood improvement and compare music to a placebo condition designed to reduce demand effects. In the present study, 60 adult participants recruited from the local community were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: music listening + art production (drawing), music listening + art sorting, no music + art production, or no music + art sorting. By giving participants in all four groups an “arts” task, we intended to equate expectations of improvement and thereby better rule out demand effects as a source of group differences. Self-report measures of negative mood were collected before and after the 10 min intervention period. Participants in the two music listening conditions showed greater mood enhancement compared to the two non-music conditions. However, there were no significant effects of the art conditions (production vs. sorting). These results document that music listening has specific efficacy in enhancing mood even when expectations of improvement are equated across groups.

Here, we show that internally generated encoding activities mediate EC effects: Neutral conditioned stimuli (CS) faces were paired with positive and negative unconditioned stimuli (US) faces. Depending on the encoding task (Is CS a friend vs. enemy of US?), Experiment 1 yielded either normal EC effects (CS adopting US valence) or a reversal. This pattern was conditional on the degree to which encoding judgements affirmed friend or enemy encoding schemes. Experiments 2a and 2b replicated these findings with more clearly valenced US faces and controlling for demand effects. Experiment 3 demonstrated unconditional encoding effects when participants generated friend or enemy relations between CS and US faces. Explicitly stated friend or enemy relations in Experiment 4 left EC effects unaffected. Together, these findings testify to the importance of higher order cognitive processes in conditioning, much in line with recent evidence on the crucial role of conditioning awareness.

"1174","Violencia entre iguales en Educación Primaria: El papel de los compañeros y su relación con el estatus sociométrico","During the last decade, there has been a change in peer harassment research from a focus on the characteristics of the Aggressor-Victim dyad to the recognition of peer harassment as a whole group process, with most of children playing some kind of role. This study uses a shortened adaptation of the Participant-Role Questionnaire approach to identify these roles in 2,050 Spanish children aged 8 to 13 years. These Participant Roles were related to belonging to one of the five sociometric status groups. Factor analysis revealed four different roles, indicating that the adapted scale remains a reliable way of distinguishing the Aggressor, Victim, Defender of the victim, and Outsider roles. Boys played the roles of Aggressor and Victim significantly more frequently. The children's Participant Role was found to be related to their sociometric status. Progress in the measurement of peer harassment as a group process and the success of intervention strategies may depend on finding clearer distinctions among the different peer roles, mobilizing peer pressure, and isolating aggressors from their social support.

"1175","The relationship between bullying roles and children's everyday dyadic interactions","This study investigated the behaviour and communication of seven- to eight-year-old children during a dyadic computer task. The children participating were identified by peers as: (1) initiators of bullying (‘bullies’); (2) defenders of those victimised (‘defenders’); and (3) those who generally do not take on a consistent role in relation to bullying (‘non-role’ children). Children were videotaped during the task and the interaction was coded, 34 dyads participated. Defenders used significantly higher levels of supportive communication such as explanation and guidance than bullies. The task performance of dyads consisting of defenders with non-role children was significantly superior to that of dyads comprising bullies plus non-role children. The behaviour of the non-role children was influenced according to whether they were working with a bully, a defender or another non-role child. The study suggests that the roles that children adopt in relation to bullying influence their behaviour in other, non-bullying contexts.

"1176","The development of the Social Bullying Involvement Scales","This study reports findings of a newly developed measure of social bullying based on Underwood's |2003| framework of social aggression. The Social Bullying Involvement Scales (SBIS) consist of four scales measuring the extent to which children experience social victimization, engage in social bullying, witness social bullying, and intervene in social bullying. The sample consisted of 636 participants (311 females and 325 males, age range 11-16 years; 71% White). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a revised version of Underwood's framework for each of the four participant role scales. Internal consistencies for each scale ranged from .93 to .97. Results revealed that social victimization was related to an increase in anxiety, depressive, and externalizing behaviors. Social bullying was associated with an increase in general externalizing behaviors only. Social witnessing was moderately correlated with depression scores. Intervening in social bullying was not linked with psychological maladjustment or externalizing behaviors. The SBIS provides a comprehensive measure of social victimization, social bullying, social witnessing, and social intervening.

"1177","Associations between job strain and the cortisol/DHEA-S ratio among management and nonmanagement personnel","Objective: To assess associations between the main, nonlinear, and interactive effects of the demand-control-support (DCS) model and the cortisol/dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) ratio, a biomarker of psychophysical well-being. Methods: Subjects were 596 employees from all occupational levels of a German airplane manufacturing plant. Multiple regression models controlling for age and gender were computed separately for employees with ( n = 103) and without ( n = 493) management responsibilities. Results: Among employees without management responsibilities, the dimensions of the DCS model did not predict the cortisol/DHEA-S ratio. In contrast, among employees with management responsibilities, both linear and nonlinear job demand effects explained a substantial fraction of the cortisol/DHEA-S variance. Increasing levels of job demands were associated with decreasing cortisol/DHEA-S ratios (linear effect) with the quartile of moderately high levels of job demands representing an optimal level. Furthermore, we observed a significant nonlinear effect with job control and a significant interaction between job demands and job control among employees with management responsibilities. These results suggest a beneficial effect associated with moderate levels of job control. This may be due to a buffering effect against adverse levels of job demands (interactive effect) and the independent association with decreased cortisol/DHEA-S ratios (nonlinear effect). Conclusion: This is the first study that provides evidence that the DCS model is associated with the cortisol/DHEA-S ratio. Among employees with management responsibilities, moderate levels of job control may help managers to cope effectively with job demands and may induce a favorable cortisol/DHEA-S ratio.

"1178","What influences Internet-based learning?","The aim in this study was to determine whether Internet-based learning is affected by perceived playfulness, satisfaction, and the performance expectancy effect. The performance expectancy of students based on experience may also be generated directly by the target that caused the emotions. Thus, we used perceived playfulness to explore the impact of performance expectancy. Data collected from 600 university students in Taiwan were tested against the research model using structural equation modeling. The results strongly support the proposed model in predicting performance expectancy when using Internet-based learning. Several implications for social influence, perceived playfulness, satisfaction, and performance expectancy research in relation to Internet-based learning are discussed.

"1179","Service co-creation in community-based aged healthcare","Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to identify and describe the themes underlying four concepts: client orientation, client involvement, provider empowerment, and client empowerment, which have been reported in the literature as influencing service participant interaction in the formation of a service. The meaning that service participants assign to each of those themes is also to be examined. Design/methodology/approach: Triadic studies were undertaken in two separate locations with three discrete community-based service networks, purposively recruited from the same aged healthcare organisation. Using a phenomological approach, 29 individual semi-structured in-depth interviews with managers, providers, and clients were conducted. Inductive and deductive analysis was used to identify the emerging themes and their meaning for each participant category. Findings: Key themes were identified for each concept, but the meaning ascribed to each theme was found to differ between the participant categories. It is suggested that these results reflect participant role differences in the service co-creation process. Research limitations/implications: The findings are limited by the small sample and its relative homogeneity. Practical implications: The findings offer service managers insights into how to engage clients in the service creation process, which in turn will affect the ultimate quality of the service that is created. They also provide information that will assist with service design, staff selection, training, and assessment. Originality/value: This is the first study that investigates the four concepts, client orientation, client involvement, provider empowerment, and client empowerment, in the context of service co-creation. It identifies associated abstract themes and the applied meaning differences of the service participants.

"1180","Determining the information that participants need: Methods of active information search","To investigate spontaneous information acquisition, a method is necessary that avoids the methodical limitations imposed by both traditional approaches. The method of active information search (AIS) was developed to deal with the problem of how the information a decision maker needs can be measured with as little demand effects as possible. The central procedural characteristics of the AIS method are the following: The participant is presented with a scenario description and usually some basic information about the alternatives (we call this step Reading). After reading the scenario the participant may pose as many questions as wanted to the experimenter in order to get further information (Questions). After each question, the participant receives a prepared answer (Answers). If he or she thinks they have received a sufficient amount of information, the participant decides (Decision). We use two types of AIS procedures, basic and list, that differ in the way participants acquire information. The basic as well as the list version of AIS can be transformed into a computer program.

"1181","Separating the visual sentence N400 effect from the P400 sequential expectancy effect: Cognitive and neuroanatomical implications","The N400 is an event-related potential (ERP) component that is elicited by semantically meaningful stimuli; one of its defining characteristics is that it is amplified for sentence completions that are semantically unexpected or incongruous with the preceding context. Some prior reports using visual sentence reading paradigms have suggested that there may also be a Cz-centered P400 (a P400cz) that is also responding to semantic congruity manipulations, distinct from the classic Pz-centered N400 (the N400pz). In the present experiment, sentences were presented visually one word at a time, and half of the sentences ended with a semantically incongruent ending. High-density 129-channel event-related potential data were recorded from 26 participants. A combination of temporo-spatial principal components analysis (PCA) and item averaging was applied to decompose the waveforms. The presence of the P400cz was confirmed. The P400cz was much more sensitive to congruity and somewhat more sensitive to cloze probability than the N400pz. The separation of the N400 semantic effect into these two portions is consistent with both MEG studies and intracranial studies. The data suggest that the N400pz has its major source in the bilateral anterior medial temporal lobe (AMTL) whereas it is suggested that the P400cz has its major source in the medial parietal region. It is further suggested that whereas the N400pz process appears to be semantic in nature, some prior reports suggest that the P400cz reflects a general sequential expectancy system.

"1182","Same wording, distinct concepts? Testing differences between expectancies and motives in a mediation model of alcohol outcomes","Per definition, alcohol expectancies (after alcohol I expect X), and drinking motives (I drink to achieve X) are conceptually distinct constructs. Theorists have argued that motives mediate the association between expectancies and drinking outcomes. Yet, given the use of different instruments, do these constructs remain distinct when assessment items are matched? The present study tested to what extent motives mediated the link between expectancies and alcohol outcomes when identical items were used, first as expectancies and then as motives. A linear structural equation model was estimated based on a national representative sample of 5,779 alcohol-using students in Switzerland (mean age = 15.2 years). The results showed that expectancies explained up to 38% of the variance in motives. Together with motives, they explained up to 48% of the variance in alcohol outcomes (volume, 5+ drinking, and problems). In 10 of 12 outcomes, there was a significant mediated effect that was often higher than the direct expectancy effect. For coping, the expectancy effect was close to zero, indicating the strongest form of mediation. In only one case (conformity and 5+ drinking), there was a direct expectancy effect but no mediation. To conclude, the study demonstrates that motives are distinct from expectancies even when identical items are used. Motives are more proximally related to different alcohol outcomes, often mediating the effects of expectancies. Consequently, the effectiveness of interventions, particularly those aimed at coping drinkers, should be improved through a shift in focus from expectancies to drinking motives.

Positive response distortion primarily reflected denial/minimization of Neuroticism and accentuation of traits associated with moralistic bias (Agreeableness and Conscientiousness). Validity of the NEO PI-R research validity scale, Positive Presentation Management, was weakly supported with respect to the Neuroticism domain only.

The sample consisted of 6,980 primary school children from Grades 3–5, who were nested within 378 classrooms in 77 schools. These students filled out Internet-based questionnaires in their schools’ computer labs. The results from multilevel models indicated that the associations between victimization and its two risk factors—social anxiety and peer rejection—were strongest in classrooms that were high in reinforcing bullying and low in defending the victims. This suggests that bystanders’ behaviors in bullying situations moderate the effects of individual and interpersonal risk factors for victimization. Influencing these behaviors might be an effective way to protect vulnerable children from victimization.

"1185","Do perceptions of discrepancy between self and group norms contribute to peer harassment at school?","This study examined the extent to which adolescents systematically perceive a discrepancy between private and group norms about the acceptability of bullying and examined the association between norm estimation and actual bystander behavior. Ninety-one 8th graders (42 male and 49 female) described their personal attitudes about bullies and victims as well as their perceptions of their classmates' attitudes. Teachers rated adolescents' participant roles during bullying episodes at school. Results provided support for the premise that teens systematically perceive their peers to hold less prosocial views (e.g., to be more tolerant of bullies, less empathic toward victims, and less inclined to believe they have a responsibility to protect victims) than they themselves do. This tendency to perceive oneself as “out of step” with the group (i.e., pluralistic ignorance) was particularly salient among girls. In addition, there was a significant association between perceived self-other discrepancy in attitudes toward bullying and adolescents' actual bystander behavior when confronted by peer harassment. The more students viewed themselves as out-of-step with group norms about bullying, the higher their teacher-rated scores on passive bystander behavior. Potential implications of these findings and future directions are discussed.

"1186","The effect of congruency between sound-source location and verbal message semantics of in-vehicle navigation systems","In-vehicle navigation systems use an auditory interface to avoid redirecting drivers’ visual attention when interaction with the devices is required. Since most of these systems emit sounds from the installation location of the devices, there are situations when the sound-source location conflicts with the message’s semantics. This research studied the effect of congruency on recall accuracy and response time after a distraction period during which participants had to perform a modified Brown–Peterson task. Three conditions of verbal message presentation methods were tested: to left-ear only ( PL ), to right-ear only ( PR ), and to one of the ears according to the message semantics (PS), in which message content was either “left” or “right”. Three distraction intervals were also tested. The results indicated that the length of the distraction interval significantly reduced response time, suggesting an expectancy effect in the presence of distractions. The presentation condition did not have significant effect on error rate. The data were further divided into two conditions: the congruent condition, which was equivalent to PS, and the conflicting condition, for PL and PR . The analysis showed that the congruent/conflicting condition significantly affected the error rate; the data revealed that congruent condition had a lower error rate. The findings have implications for the design of verbal messages with semantics that are spatial in nature.

Using a cross-informant approach (self- and teacher-reports), bullying was assessed among 550 children between the ages of 6.5 and 10.8 years attending 12 regular primary schools in Bremen and Lower Saxony, Germany. Overall, 10 percent of children were classified as bullies, 17.4 percent as victims and 16.5 percent as bully/victims, with boys being bullies and bully/victims more often than girls. Direct bullying was more likely directed at, and employed by, boys. Indirect/relational bullying occurred less frequently and mainly within same-gender groups. Results from logistic regression analyses showed that, apart from age and gender, low parental educational levels were a significant predictor for a child’s bullying status (bully, victim, bully/victim).

"1190","Patient- or physician-oriented marketing: What drives primary demand for prescription drugs?","The authors analyze primary demand effects of marketing efforts directed at the physician (detailing and professional journal advertising) versus marketing efforts directed at the patient (direct-to-consumer advertising). The analysis covers 86 categories, or approximately 85% of the U.S. pharmaceutical market, during the 2001–2005 period. Primary demand effects are rather small, in contrast with the estimated sales effects for individual brands. By using a new brand-level method to estimate primary demand effects with aggregate data, the authors show that the small effects are due to intense competitive interactions during the observation period but not necessarily to low primary demand responsiveness. In contrast with previous studies, the authors also find that detailing is more effective in driving primary demand than direct-to-consumer advertising. A category sales model cannot provide such insights. In addition, a category sales model likely produces biased predictions about period-by-period changes in primary demand. The suggested brand-level method does not suffer from these limitations.

"1191","Integrating sentence-structural and event information in early verb learning","Children use syntax as well as observations of events to learn verb meanings. This is known as syntactic bootstrapping. This dissertation investigated the origins and mechanisms of syntactic bootstrapping. Prior evidence suggested that two-year-olds, but not younger children, could use aspects of sentence structure to assign different interpretations to novel transitive and intransitive verbs. Persistent negative findings with younger children raised questions about the kind of knowledge young children need about syntax-semantics links in order to begin using sentence-structural information to learn verbs. In this dissertation, I reported evidence (Chapter 2) that 21- and 19-month-old children showed sensitivity to the sentence structure in interpreting novel transitive and intransitive verbs, as long as the number of nouns in the sentence was informative. The results suggest that syntactic bootstrapping might begin with a bias in young children to assign each noun in the sentence to a core participant-role in their conceptual representations of events. Moreover, I found that 2-year-old Mandarin learners also used the number of noun phrases in novel-verb interpretation (Chapter 3), despite frequent argument omission that makes the number of noun phrases per sentence a less reliable indicator of verb argument-structure in Mandarin than in English. This extension to Mandarin learners suggests that syntactic bootstrapping is a fundamental part of verb learning, even for learners of languages (such as Mandarin) that provide much less evidence for a reliable link between noun-phrase number and verb argument-structure in the input. Finally, I demonstrated that 2-year-olds found sentence-structural information independently informative when learning about a new verb (Chapter 4). Specifically, 2-year-olds learned about a new verb's combinatorial privileges—transitivity and participant-role number—from brief dialogues alone, and later retrieved this information to guide their interpretation of the verb when it was presented in a referential context. The results suggest that verb learning is rooted in children's learning about the combinatorial properties of verbs. Given a simple bias toward a one-to-one mapping between nouns in sentences and participant-roles in their construals of events, children can use what they learn about the combinatorial privileges of particular verbs to figure out skeletal aspects of their meanings.

"1192","Cognitive and academic gains as a result of cognitive training","The purpose of this study was to test Feuersetein's Structural Cognitive Modifiability model by evaluating changes in cognitive skills and reading scores after participation in one of two cognitive skills training programs. The Woodcock Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities and Tests of Achievement, 3 rd editions were used as evaluation tools. Specific scores evaluated included General Intellectual Ability (GIA), Working Memory (MW), Sound Awareness (SA), and Word Attack (WA). Three groups, differentiated by parent report, were studied. These groups included; Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Dyslexia, and students who were not reported to have any type of disability. The intervention programs differed by focus (Reading or Cognitive) and intensity of training. Significant differences were found between pre and post test scores for all four variables measured. GIA scores increased from pre- to post-test by almost one standard deviation. MW and SA scores increased 2/3 of a standard deviation, and a five standard score point gain was achieved for WA. There were no significant differences in gain scores between intervention groups in regards to intensity of training or diagnostic group. Students enrolled in the reading-focused intervention group showed slightly higher gains in WA when compared to students in cognitive-focused intervention programs. Students enrolled in the cognitive-focused intervention programs showed larger growth for GIA when compared to students in reading focused intervention. No significant differences were found between intervention groups on measures of MW or SA. Limitations of the current study included lack of a control group and the use of parent reported diagnoses to differentiate diagnosis groups. Additionally, examiner effects including the halo or expectancy effect may have impacted scores at post-test. The sample was limited in regards to ethnicity and SES, which may limit generalizability of findings to other ethnic or SES groups. Directions for future studies may include using more robust achievement measures to evaluate academics before and after training, and getting confirmed diagnoses from medical and psychoeducational reports to differentiate groups. Follow up assessment to determine if gains are maintained in the long-term and focus on gains in particular areas of reading may allow for more specific interpretation of findings.

"1194","Promotion induced competitive effects: Two essays","This dissertation focuses on the empirical generalizations related to retailer promotions. Two essays are developed addressing the generalizations. The first essay addresses the contradiction in the calculations of primary and secondary demand effects. A mathematical proof is developed to show that under Nested Logit modeling, competitors' gain assumption is violated. An alternative explanation is provided to calculate the primary and secondary demand effects. The second essay focuses on the empirical generalization of the neighborhood price effect. The effects of share and quality in shaping the neighborhood price effect are hypothesized and tested. Further, based on the evidence that neighborhood price effect and asymmetric share effect generally go together and contradict the market power notion, a related hypothesis is tested. This essay brings out new potential empirical generalizations.

"1195","Weaker readers as experts: The effects of preferential instruction on the fluency improvement of lower-performing student tutors","This study attempted to determine whether giving lower-performing tutors preferential treatment over their higher-performing tutees before they engaged in peer tutoring sessions may help increase the reading achievement for these lower-performing tutors. The preferential treatment consisted of giving teacher-delivered instruction in a targeted text only to the tutors and verbally announcing this fact to both the tutors and tutees as a status treatment. A comparison group of lower-performing tutors was created in which both the tutors and their tutees received similar instruction in the targeted text, thereby eliminating the preferential treatment for the lower performing tutors. Tutor achievement was assessed after the instruction phase—to investigate a possible teaching expectancy effect—and after the peer tutoring phase. Tutors were assessed in reading fluency accuracy and fluency rate. Qualitative analysis, employing video data, was used to examine tutor behaviors which might indicate the tutors' interest and engagement in the activities. Eighty second grade students (40 lower performing tutors and 40 higher performing tutees) from two urban public schools participated in the study. Results indicated that the experimental tutors significantly outperformed the comparison tutors on both fluency accuracy and fluency rate after participating in the peer tutoring sessions. The experimental tutors, in contrast with the comparison tutors, also provided more assistance to their tutees.

"1196","Role combinations, role trajectories, and physical health: Findings from a national longitudinal study of Americans","The role context approach suggests that certain role combinations are riskier for physical health while others are protective, and this dissertation provided an innovative approach to investigating this premise by using theory and previous research to guide the creation of a role typology, consisting of distinct combinations of roles, that were then linked to physical health profiles. It further considered how role quantity and changes in role types over time, designated as role trajectories, impacted health. Three studies were conducted using longitudinal data from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study, a national sample of women and men ages 35 to 84 who participated in two waves of data collection (N=1805), as well as a subset who provided extensive biological information (N=887). Study 1 showed that role combinations and role quantity were associated with current physical health, and some evidence suggested the specific role combination occupied also influenced health change across time. Having protective primary roles along with a volunteer and/or religious participant role was linked with better current health and the maintenance of better health across time, relative to other role types, thereby supporting the role context approach. Considering changes in role combinations over time, Study 2 revealed that role trajectories were associated with current health and change in health across time, thus providing some support that an individual's role trajectory was leading to health changes, and that some effects were not due entirely to individuals modifying their role commitments in response to health changes. There was compelling evidence that individuals in protective role types across time had the best health profiles relative to other role trajectories, while individuals on a persistent risk trajectory tended to have the worst health. Regarding links between role involvement and biomarkers, Study 3 found little support that having a higher quantity of roles was beneficial for biological health or that individuals on a persistent protection trajectory had more optimal biological regulation. Overall, role types and role trajectories had noteworthy links to physical health, suggesting this innovative approach to investigating role combinations is useful for future studies of role involvement.

"1197","Music as an unconditioned stimulus: Positive and negative effects of country music on implicit attitudes, explicit attitudes, and brand choice","An experiment ( N = 68) explored how background music in a realistic web advertisement could condition implicit and explicit attitudes toward a novel brand. Conditioning effects were apparent in both traditional explicit attitude measures and also in the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Further, brand choice was predicted by explicit attitudes, but prediction improved significantly when implicit attitudes were considered. Mood-congruent judgment, demand effects, and conditioning are considered as potential explanations for our results, and we argue that conditioning provides the most parsimonious explanation. Finally, the results are discussed within the context of the associative-propositional evaluation model (Gawronski &amp; Bodenhausen, 2006). This model provides a framework for the integration of the implicit attitude construct into the study of consumer behavior.

"1198","Assigned versus random, countermeasure-like responses in the P300 based complex trial protocol for detection of deception: Task demand effects","We recently introduced an accurate and countermeasure resistant P300-based deception detection test called the complex trial protocol (Rosenfeld et al. in Psychophysiology 45(6):906–919, 2008). When subjects use countermeasures to all irrelevant items in the test, the probe P300 is increased rather than reduced (as it was in previous P300-based deception protocols), allowing detection of countermeasure users. The current experiment examines the role of task demand on the complex trial protocol by forcing the subject to make countermeasure-like response to stimuli. Subjects made either a simple random button response to both probe and irrelevant stimuli (experiment 1) or a more complex, assigned, button response to probe and irrelevant stimuli (experiment 2). We found that an increase in task demand reduced the effectiveness of the test. Using random responses we found a simple guilty hit rate of 11/12 with no false positives, but only a 4/11 hit rate for countermeasure-users. Using assigned responses we found a simple guilty hit rate of 8/15 with no false positives, and a 7/16 hit rate for countermeasure-users. We herein suggest that the high level of task demand associated with these countermeasure-like responses causes reduced hit rates.

"1200","Unique and interactive effects of empathy and social status on involvement in bullying","This study investigated the relationships between affective and cognitive empathy, social preference and perceived popularity, and involvement in bullying situations by bullying others or defending the victimized children. The participants were 266 primary and 195 secondary school students. Affective and cognitive empathy, as well as the status variables, had some significant main effects on involvement in bullying. In addition, several interaction effects emerged. For instance, the positive association between affective empathy and defending behavior was stronger among boys who had a high status (i.e., were highly preferred) in the group. The results highlight the importance of studying child-by-environment models, which take into account both child characteristics and interpersonal variables in predicting social adjustment.

"1201","The modified stroop task as a clinical tool for the assessment of health anxiety","Health anxiety is a dimensional concept ranging from minor concerns about bodily sensations and health at one end of a continuum to clinically significant health-related fears and constant worry about sensations, combined with disease conviction, at the other end (Salkovskis &amp; Warwick, 1986). To date, subjective instruments (i.e., self-report) have been considered the only practical methods of assessing health anxiety. These measures are, however, susceptible to distortion and demand effects (particularly given the negative stereotype surrounding one form of health anxiety, hypochondriasis). Research suggests that relative colour-naming latencies as assessed by the Modified Stroop Paradigm (MSP) may represent a powerful assessment technique. This technique focuses on attentional bias towards health information by asking participants to look at a series of words, to ignore the meaning of the words, and to state the colour the words are written in. An inability to keep one's attention away from relevant words (e.g., cancer) is demonstrated by an increase in the amount of time taken to name the colour it has been presented in. This bias, to pay excessive attention to information about health and illness, is predicted by the cognitive-behavioural model of health anxiety and has received empirical support. One purpose of this investigation was to create preliminary normative MSP tables and provide psychometric support for the Modified Stroop Paradigm-Health Anxiety Screen (MSP-HAS) as unique tool to assess health anxiety. A second purpose was to provide evidence in support of the cognitive-behavioural model of health anxiety. Three studies were completed employing 33 Student participants, 45 Psychiatric participants, and 16 Medical participants; preliminary normative values for these groups are offered. As expected, Student participants did not demonstrate significant elevations in health anxiety or MSP-HAS scores. Psychiatric participants with high health anxiety displayed elevations in Illness colour-word naming latencies as compared to those without high health anxiety. MSP-HAS scores for Psychiatric participants without elevated health anxiety were similar to those found in the non-clinical Student group. Pre-surgical Medical participants demonstrated elevations in Illness colour-word naming latencies despite denying health anxious thoughts as typically measured by self-report instruments. Sensitivity to change was also demonstrated; MSP-HAS scores dropped significantly from pre-surgery to successful post-surgery. Test-retest reliability, internal consistency, convergent validity, construct validity, and content validity of the MSP-HAS were supported. By employing the MSP-HAS alongside more conventional questionnaire measures of health anxiety, important information was collected about the three main categories of individuals studied, the cognitive-behavioural model of anxiety, and the dimensional conceptualization of health anxiety. The use of the MSP-HAS as a potential objective measure of health anxiety was supported, with the potential to decrease clinicians' reliance on client self-report. Additional clinical implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)","","","","","","Owens, Katherine M.

"1202","The relationship among bullying participant roles, social support, and school climate","The National School Safety Center (NSSC) declared bullying to be of the most enduring problems in U.S. schools. Past research has focused on characteristics and outcomes of bullies and victims. Recently, leading researchers have indicated a need to investigate other participants in bullying situations. Furthermore, leading researchers have indicated a need to examine variables that sustain or deter bullying within the context of the social ecological model. Social support and school climate are two constructs within the social ecological model that warrant further investigation. There were two major goals of the current study. The first goal was to develop a psychometrically sound measurement tool that can be used to classify children and adolescents into participant roles in bullying situations. The second goal of this study was to examine the relationship among participant roles, social support, and school climate. Results indicate that the Bullying Participant Role Survey (BPRS) is a reliable and valid tool for identifying participant roles in bullying situations. Furthermore, results of this study indicate that various participants in bullying situations have different perceptions of social support and school climate. These findings, as well as implications and the direction of future research, are discussed.

"1203","Bullying im grundschulalter: Mitschülerrollen und ihre transkontextuelle stabilität","When bullying happens in secondary school peer involvement and distinct participant roles for nine often children (as bully, assistant, reinforcer, defender, outsider or victim) are well evidenced. However, it is still unclear to what extent this applies to primary school children: How precise do they represent roles and how stable is individual role behavior across different contexts? For all 251 children (53% male) of a Munich primary school (6 to 10 years, first to fourth grade) Participant Roles in bullying (Salmivalli, Lagerspetz, Björkqvist, Osterman, Kaukiainen, 1996) were assessed in standardized interviews. Additionally, for 119 of these children (58 % male) a participant role could be identified in their after school group (Hort). Our findings confirm the existence of distinct participant roles in bullying for primary school children, but a high intercorrelation between the pro-aggressive roles is noticeable. Especially the bully and the victim role turn out to be quite stable across contexts. An analysis by grades suggests a considerable impact of contextual characteristics: children's behavior in bullying situations seems to be affected by the range of behavioral choices the different contexts provide.

"1204","Attachment and empathy as predictors of roles as defenders or outsiders in bullying interactions","Bullying almost always occurs in the presence of peers, most of whom do not intervene to stop it. This study examined the role of attachment, empathy, and gender in predicting the behavior of 105 middle school students who reported being either (a) defenders who actively intervened to stop bullying, or (b) outsiders who were either not involved or stood by passively. It was hypothesized that gender, attachment to mother, attachment to father, and empathy would predict whether children nominated themselves as defenders in bullying situations. A hierarchical logistic regression analysis indicated that these variables together significantly predicted whether children nominated themselves as defenders or outsiders. Gender was not a unique significant predictor. Attachment to mother contributed significant unique variance to the model, but attachment to father did not after accounting for gender and attachment to mother. Empathy contributed significant unique variance to the model even after accounting for all other variables. Results suggest that middle school personnel should openly discuss with students their roles in bullying interactions. In addition, teaching empathy towards others and involving parents may be critical components in comprehensive prevention programs.

"1205","Placebo effects: Clinical aspects and neurobiology","Placebo effects are beneficial health outcomes not related to the relatively direct biological effects of an intervention and can be elicited by an agent that, by itself, is inert. Understanding these placebo effects will help to improve clinical trial design, especially for interventions such as surgery, CNS-active drugs and behavioural interventions which are often non-blinded. A literature review was performed to retrieve articles discussing placebo implications of clinical trials, the neurobiology of placebo effects and the implications of placebo effect for several disorders of neurological relevance. Recent research in placebo analgesia and other conditions has demonstrated that several neurotransmitter systems, such as opiate and dopamine, are involved with the placebo effect. Brain regions including anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia have been activated following administration of placebo. A patient's expectancy of improvement may influence outcomes as much as some active interventions and this effect may be greater for novel interventions and for procedures. Maximizing this expectancy effect is important for clinicians to optimize the health of their patient. There have been many relatively acute placebo studies that are now being extended into clinically relevant models of placebo effect.

"1206","Anatomie von kommunikationsrollen. Methoden zur identifizierung von akteursrollen in gerichteten netzwerken","The identification of generalizable roles in social systems has been one of the most central issues in social science ever since. Particularly in the field of interpersonal communication, the notion of communication roles has been used to describe and better understand the complex processes in social groups and society. This contribution identifies the theoretical and methodological concepts that have to be considered when roles in directed networks are operationalized. Based on a network analytic approach and critically evaluating the shortcomings of some widely used models, this study aims to propose new concepts for the operationalization of communication roles. These concepts can be divided into two distinctive approaches. One possibility is to use microstructures like dyadic and triadic communication roles as basic units. For this approach, different aggregation rules are discussed which are necessary for their application in more complex networks. The second approach takes the overall structure of a network into account and identifies different roles by applying centrality measures, blockmodelling or hierarchical structure analysis tools. For illustrative reasons, this study limits its focus on the operationalization of communication roles as a prominent object in social science research. The concepts presented, however, are applicable for directed graphs in general.

One hundred and thirteen adolescents (M age = 15.88 years, 51% female) completed measures of sympathy, guilt, empathic anger, shame, moral reasoning, and internalization. Factor analyses revealed two dimensions of conscience: moral affect (which included guilt, shame, sympathy, and empathic anger) and moral cognition (which included internalization and prosocial moral reasoning). Parental discipline related to both dimensions of conscience, albeit in different ways. High levels of parental inductive discipline and low levels of parental power assertion were associated with high levels of moral affect, whereas high levels of persistent discipline were associated with increased moral cognition. High negative reactivity, however, was only associated with high levels of moral affect. In general, higher levels of moral affect were associated with prosocial behavior and moral conduct during bullying. Higher levels of moral cognition were associated with less participation in bullying, more altruistic behavior, and more frequent helping of the victims of bullying. The discussion focuses on the dimensions of moral conscience in adolescence.

Bullying-related behavior was assessed using a peer nomination procedure. Children rated the importance of being accepted by each particular classmate and their own acceptance of these same classmates.

"1210","Persuasion and the contexts of dissuasion: Causal models and informal arguments","This paper develops the view that in arguing informally individuals construct a dual representation in which there is a coupling of arguments and the structure of the qualitative (mental) causal model to which these refer. Invited to consider a future possibility, individuals generate a causal model and mentally simulate the consequences of certain actions. Their arguments refer to the causal paths in the model. Correspondingly, faced with specific arguments about a policy option they generate a model with particular causal paths and mentally simulate the outcomes. The results of Experiment 1 are consistent with this notion. Decisions on the percentage of funds to be allocated to genetically modified (GM) crop research depended on the structure of the arguments elicited in response to imagining a future state of affairs. Specifically, the presence of a dissuasive argument eliminated the impact of any persuasive argument. The non-monotonic properties of everyday informal argument can then be seen as a corollary of change to causal structure in the model. The dual representation view predicts that the impact of a dissuasive argument will depend on the structure of the causal model. Experiment 2 tested and confirmed this prediction by requiring individuals to judge the relative persuasiveness of two cases referring either to a model with two independent causal paths or to a model in which one causal path depended on the other. In contrast to Experiment 1, prior opinion on GM crop research did not affect allocation decisions. An advisory role in contrast to a participant role may encourage a more decontextualised mode of thinking. According to the dual representation view, ease of mental simulation should exert wide-ranging effects on judgements and the rhetoric of arguments should also be important. The paper concludes with a discussion of some of these expectations.

To determine the effect of taking pills on cognitive function, 40 participants were randomly assigned to a pill or no-pill condition. Healthy seniors who took a 2-week supply of methylcellulose pills, which they were told was an experimental cognitive enhancer, were compared to seniors not taking any pills. There were 2 primary outcome measures defined prior to the study--Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Word List delayed recall and Stroop color word task time--as well as 7 other cognitive outcome measures. There was a significant effect of pill taking on the 2 primary outcome measures. There was also an effect of pill taking on choice reaction time and Word List immediate recall but not on the other 5 secondary cognitive outcome measures. In an exploratory analysis of potential predictors of the expectancy effect, perceived stress and self-efficacy but not personality traits interacted with the pill-taking effect on cognitive function. Further characterizing and understanding this observed expectancy effect is important to maximize cognitive health and improve clinical trial design.

"1212","The dynamics of student teaching: Bringing paraeducators into the discussion","Paraeducators are playing an increasingly important role in the education of students with disabilities. At the same time, the task of supervising and managing the work of paraeducators is steadily becoming the responsibility of special education teachers. This investigation explores the role of university preservice preparation to assist special educators to work with paraeducators. Using an interpretive lens, this investigation examines the dynamics of the special education student teaching experience for student teachers, mentor teachers, and paraeducators and how this experience can be changed to effectively prepare student teachers to work with paraeducators. One-hour phone interviews were conducted with 12 student teachers, six mentor teachers, and eight paraeducators who completed a student teaching experience at a small, Midwestern university. Analyses of transcripts from these interviews were analyzed for each participant group for prominent themes as well as similarities and differences across the three participant groups. Analysis results indicated that the student teaching experience was a positive one for participants with professional relationships with colleagues playing an important role; however, participants indicated that little preparation was provided to student teachers in working with paraeducators. After these analyses, three focus group meetings were conducted with a subset of the individuals participating in the interviews. Each focus group had three participants and groups were organized by participant role with a separate group for student teachers, mentor teachers, and paraeducators. Transcripts from each focus group were compared to note prominent themes as well as similarities and differences across the different participant groups. Analyses yielded several recommendations to effectively prepare student teachers to work with paraeducators including providing coursework in this issue prior to student teaching; putting safeguards into place to allow paraeducators to give feedback to student teachers without usurping the professional authority of the student teacher; and deliberately embedding assignments that require student teacher contact with paraeducators. While this investigation represents a first step in examining how future special educators can be prepared at the preservice level to work with paraeducators, additional investigations done in the contexts of other university contexts are needed to expand and refine present results.

"1213","Examination of interaction effects within a meta-analysis: An example with the Balanced Placebo Design","Meta-analysis offers a set of quantitative techniques that allow synthesizing the results of many types of research including surveys, correlation studies, experimental studies and regression analyses. With emphasis on broad generalizations, meta-analysts tend to overlook or to down play the importance of contingency-specifying interactions that in most situations have an inferential precedence over statements about main effects. The Balanced Placebo Design is a general research paradigm that employs a 2 x 2 factorial design and controls for both expectancy set and pharmacologic action. Subjects are told that their drinks either contain an alcoholic or a nonalcoholic beverage and the beverage itself either contains alcohol or it does not. This results in four conditions and at low to moderate doses of alcohol, subjects cannot discriminate correctly the placebo and antiplacebo conditions. The expectancy belief caused by the deception of the Balanced Placebo Design can be accentuated by the introduction of moderator variables. Moderator variables are external design variables that can affect the outcome of the experiment by creating interactions. In this dissertation, it was hypothesized that two major moderator variables would affect the deception value of the expectancy effect of the balanced placebo design-the setting of the experiment and the method of assessment of the dependent variable.

"1214","Board competencies and peer mentoring","The ways that colleges and universities go about instilling and developing the necessary skills and knowledge that promote the individual and group leadership abilities of board members has received little study. The present study examined differences between postsecondary sectors in the degree to which Chait, Holland, and Taylor's six competencies of an effective board are evident in mentoring relationships, to determine the influence participants perceive mentoring to have on new board member knowledge, skills, and abilities, and to identify trends in peer mentoring which may enhance mentoring success and build new board member aptitude. The principal independent variable was institution type; the secondary independent variable was participant role. The dependent variables were the six dimensions of Chait, Holland and Taylor's competency framework of an effective board. A cross-sectional quantitative non-experimental study was implemented using an Internet-based survey to gather data from mentors, mentees, and professional board staff at participating institutions. Nine hundred twenty-seven (927) board professionals, each representing one postsecondary governing board from the Association of Governing Boards of Colleges and Universities board professional membership list, were invited to participate. Mentor and mentee participants were subsequently identified by participating board professionals. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze survey data beginning with sample demographics through a review of perceptual differences associated with each hypothesis. Results indicate that there may be a mismatch between the perceptions of board professionals, mentors, and mentees regarding the presence of training related to the mentoring program's purpose. There is also a discrepancy between mentor and mentee perception of the content of mentoring discussions. Mentors perceived discussion of each of the board competency dimensions to a greater extent than did mentees. Further research on new board member mentoring and replication of this study is recommended. Additional research should include the use and characteristics of new board member mentoring programs, board mentoring as an educational tool, mentoring evaluation methods and uses, participant training programs, and the impact of mentoring on individual and board performance, trustee retention, institutional service, and level of institutional commitment.

"1215","Does empathy predict adolescents' bullying and defending behavior?","Through structural equation modeling, this study tested a path of relations in which different levels of empathic responsiveness were posited to be differently associated to bullying and defending behavior. Three hundred and eighteen Italian adolescents (142 girls and 176 boys; mean age = 13.2 years) completed the Davis's Interpersonal Reactivity Index [Davis, 1983] for empathy and the Participant role scales [Salmivalli et al., 1996] for bullying and defending behavior. The results revealed that the model fitted the data adequately, but only in the case of boys. As hypothesized, low levels of empathic responsiveness were associated to students' involvement in bullying others. In contrast, empathy was positively associated with actively helping victimized schoolmates. However, the estimates algorithm did not reach convergence with girls' data. The current findings confirm and extend the literature on the relation between empathy, prosociality and aggressive behavior. Educational implications are also discussed.

"1216","Gewalt an schulen am beispiel von bullying: Aktuelle aspekte eines populären themas","Bullying, which comprises physical, verbal violence as well as systematic teasing and victimization by social ostracism, is highly prevalent in the everyday life of many students in schools. Mostly, bullying proves to be persistent over time and is related to a multitude of negative outcomes. Media (e.g., internet, mobile phones) support persistent victimization in terms of cyberbullying. Research on bullying mostly refers to the perspectives of the perpetrator/s and/or victim/s. However, bullying often occurs in the presence of other participants and may be seen as a phenomenon with underlying group dynamics (participant role approach). A controversial issue refers to the question of whether some bullies are ""social intelligent perpetrators"", using certain victimizing behavior strategies in a ""machiavellistic manner"" to reach personal goals by social manipulation. The findings presented lead us to conclusions with regard to efficacious preventions and interventions for schools.

"1217","Syntactic alignment and participant role in dialogue","We report three experiments that investigated whether the linguistic behavior of participants in a dialogue is affected by their role within that interaction. All experiments were concerned with the way in which speakers choose between syntactic forms with very similar meanings. Theories of dialogue assume that speakers address their contributions directly to their addressees, but also indirectly to side participants. In Experiments 1 and 2, speakers produced picture descriptions that had the same syntactic structure as a previous speaker's descriptions which had been addressed to a third person. This indicated that syntactic alignment is not limited to speaker-addressee dyads. However, the prior participant role of the current speaker affected alignment: prior addressees aligned more than prior side-participants. In contrast, Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that alignment was unaffected by the prior participant role of the current addressee. We interpret these findings in terms of depth of processing during encoding.

"1218","Expectancy effects in social stereotyping: Automatic and controlled processing in the Neely paradigm","This research attempted to extend the classic cognition study, Neely (1977), to the domain of social stereotypes. Neely demonstrated the existence of automatic and controlled processing in the same paradigm and the differing effects these processes have on accessing category information. The current research extended these findings by using social groups and stereotypes as stimuli, rather than nonsocial categories. Participants were told to expect characteristics of the Black stereotype following the prime CHINESE, characteristics of the Chinese stereotype following the prime BLACK, and characteristics of the criminal stereotype following the prime CRIMINAL. These expectancies were true most of the time. Participants then completed a lexical decision task in which SOA was manipulated (250 vs. 2,000 ms). Participants responded faster to semantically related targets (i.e., stereotypes) in the 250-ms SOA condition, regardless of their explicit expectancies. In the 2,000-ms SOA condition, participants responded faster to expected targets than to unexpected targets, regardless of whether or not the targets were semantically related to the primes. When the data from the two conditions were combined, the expectancy effect remained whereas the semantic relation effect did not. Results are discussed in terms of the automatic and controlled processing of social stimuli, and the importance of understanding expectancies in social stereotyping.

"1219","Event-related potential correlates of phasic and tonic measures of the orienting reflex","We examined putative central nervous system (CNS) indices of tonic and phasic aspects of the orienting reflex (OR) in a passive event-related potential (ERP) dishabituation paradigm. Pre-stimulus skin conductance level (SCL) and the subsequent skin conductance response (SCR) were used as tonic and phasic OR ""yard-sticks"", respectively. Their stimulus-response patterns were used to assess two ERP components: the tonic pre-stimulus contingent negative variation (CNV) and the subsequent phasic late positive complex (LPC). SCLs and SCRs derived from each trial of the first train presented were compatible with traditional OR studies. Across-train means were also derived for each of the four measures examined. Arousal changes, as indexed by the SCL, were weak in the CNV which showed an additional expectancy effect. The LPC showed a stimulus-response pattern across trials identical to that of the SCR. This study clarifies links between the traditional autonomic measures of the indifferent OR and its CNS correlates, and encourages an OR perspective and/or interpretation of ERP effects.

"1221","Effects of critical peak pricing on residential electricity use in California","The basic tenet of setting rates for regulated utilities is that rates should match costs. Until recently, standard electricity metering infrastructure could not provide a real-time link between retail rates and time-varying wholesale costs. Given decreasing costs of more advanced meters, time-varying and dynamic rates like critical peak pricing (CPP) have become the subject of much political interest. Due to lack of experience with the new rates, however, policy makers are hesitant to implement dynamic pricing in the residential sector. This study examined the residential demand effects of CPP tariffs on a group designed to be representative of the California population. Participants were given only the most basic components of a CPP tariff: a TOU rate with 15 critical peak events per year, an interval meter, and personal notification (by telephone) of events. An averaging of load impacts by temperature showed that response to CPP was highest when local maximum daily temperatures were above 90deg;F. With few exceptions, however, participants responded to CPP events at all temperatures. A regression of load response on time and temperature variables for the 12 summer events in 2004 indicated a significant (6.2%) load drop across the five critical peak hours. Evidence of load shifting was seen soon after the event notification was received and in the hours immediately following the event. Unexpectedly, the average response to a $0.68 critical price was not higher than the response for a $0.50 critical price. Finally, a cross-analysis of load response, bill impacts, and satisfaction levels by usage and income was conducted to test policy goals of targeting and statewide residential implementation. The analysis showed that, while large customers did provide the largest load relief during events, small customers received proportionally larger discounts on their electricity bills, implying that targeting large customers for CPP rates is not good policy on grounds of equity. Results also showed that high-income customers did not benefit financially more than did low-income customers, and that differences in satisfaction levels across income levels were statistically insignificant, implying that a policy goal of mandatory or default residential CPP rates is not challenged.

"1222","Dynamics of preschoolers self-regulation: Viewed through the lens of conflict resolution strategies during peer free-play","The process of self-regulation (SR) qualitatively transforms children's cognitive, social, and emotional capacities. Based on Vygotsky's (1978) theory, it can be argued that SR comes into existence, materializes, and is practiced during play. The main purpose of this study was to further the understanding of preschoolers' SR dynamics during social free-play. There were three waves of naturalistic observations involving 19 NYC preschoolers during classroom free-play. Several coding schemes were used as markers of group SR. An in depth understanding of group SR was achieved by analyzing the types of conflicts children engaged in, their frequency, and patters of how children resolved these conflicts during social play. Children-in-conflict activity-in-context was the key unit-of-analysis as well as the major result of this investigation. Advanced play, conflict and conflict resolution strategies during preschool free-play were conceptualized as leading level activities for complex SR. As children engaged in many more complex conflicts over dramatic play and sharing of the play constructs, play became more sophisticated and peer interactions became more collaborative and vice versa. Fantasy play was the most common play level at which conflicts occurred, especially likely so during associative and parallel peer interaction. Comparatively, younger children demonstrated simpler and less social peer play than older children. Almost all of the conflicts revolved around rules and regulations and sharing of play artifacts. Dilemmas over object distribution apparently decreased across time as children's play became more sophisticated. As a frequent conflict issue, play ideas was the topic associated with more advanced play and peer interactions. Younger preschoolers were much more likely to physically harm other children as compared to the older ones. Quite surprisingly, there was complete lack of psychological harm during free-play. Almost all of the conflicts were resolved; children predominantly used prosocial conflict resolution strategies for the observed disputes. An 'expectancy effect' was possibly found with one teacher's perception of individual behavior which was based on sex and age. Moreover, was the realization that SR dynamically changes as a function of the group along with many the momentary contextual variables. A video montage of conflicts during free-play is attached.* *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).

The present study examined the performance of 204 8-11 year olds in a set of stories that assessed understanding of cognitions and emotions, in relation to their Participant Role in bullying. Moreover, children's understanding of moral emotions and proneness to moral disengagement was assessed. Victims showed some difficulties in the social cognition task, whereas bullies did not. Aggressive children, instead, were found to be more ready to show moral disengagement mechanisms, whereas defenders showed higher levels of moral sensibility. Results are discussed in relation to the two models, and the need for further research into empathy and moral cognition of children involved in bullying episodes is highlighted.

"1226","New Participant Role Scales: Comparison Between Various Criteria for Assigning Roles and Indications for Their Validity","The present study was set up with two aims in mind. First, to assess the psychometric characteristics of a peer-report measure of bullying in a Dutch sample, and second, to compare relative and absolute ways of assigning roles in the bullying process. The sample consisted of 242 children (51% boys; mean age approximately 10 years) at T1. Two years later, there were 247 children (49% boys). We made use of an adaptation of the original Participant Role Scales (PRS) Salmivalli, Lagerspetz, Björkqvist et al., 1996; Salmivalli, Lappalainen and Lagerspetz, 1998) and of the Aggression and Victimization Scale [Perry, Kusel and Perry, 1988]. This scale, called the New PRS, consisted of 32 items in total. Five highly reliable scales were distinguished with the help of CFA, one for leader-like bullying behavior, one for follower-like bullying behavior, and scales for outsider, defender and victim. We computed the roles according to four criteria, that is, z-scores (a relative measure) and three different percentage scores (10%, 15% and 20%; each an absolute measure). Sociometric status was also assessed. The concordance between the various methods was moderate. Test-retest stability was also moderate. Test-retest coefficients for the scale scores were considerably higher. Links were found between the roles and sociometric status, irrespective of the method used for assigning roles. Victims were rejected, as were bullies, but defenders were popular. Gender differences indicated that boys were more often bullies or followers, and girls were more often outsiders or defenders. Absolute methods for assigning bullying roles produced fewer unclassifiable children and brought to light substantial differences between classes.

Differing task demands amongst scientific studies may contribute to such ambiguous results. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the performance of postural control in older adults and the relationship between visual information and body sway as a function of task demands. Old and young adults (YA) maintained an upright stance on different bases of support (normal, tandem and reduced), both with and without vision, and both with and without room movement. In the more demanding tasks, the older adults displayed greater body sway than the younger adults and older adults were more influenced by the manipulation of the visual information due to the room movement. However, in the normal support condition, the influence of the moving room was similar for the two groups. These results suggest that task demand is an important aspect to consider when examining postural control in older adults.

Results showed that the working memory training significantly enhanced general performance on working memory tasks, and in particular on visual spatial abilities.

Sixty-four children (aged 6, 8, 10 and 12) were told short stories and asked to predict whether certain circumstances would affect price or exchange rate. Explanations for their answers were also elicited and scored. Two dimensions were manipulated in the stories: Money vs. barter, and supply vs. demand. A second study (N = 64) sought to dissociate effects of supply and demand from direct and indirect causation. It was found that children can understand supply and demand to a larger extent than was thought, and that demand effects are easier to understand than supply effects. The findings are interpreted in terms of the relative complexity of the mechanism in each case.

However, warnings influenced participants' evaluations of experimental stimulus materials, with more negative evaluations produced by warnings and detailed content than by procedures only wording. Moreover, more detailed content in consent forms did not provide participants with a better sense of what the studies would entail.

"1231","Inattentional blindness, change blindness and race/ethnicity","The goal of these studies was to investigate the potential consequences of racial profiling for noticing non-profiled perpetrators. Perceptual blindness paradigms were employed in order to circumvent social desirability and other demand effects. The dynamic inattentional blindness paradigm (developed by Neisser and colleagues and adapted by Simons and Chabris) was used to test the effect of directed attention on noticing unexpected events (UE). Attention was directed to persons of one race to the exclusion of another. The unexpected event was an interloper who was the same race as the attended or ignored group. Attention to the unexpected third party was measured explicitly and implicitly. The explicit measure of attention was a report of noticing the unexpected person. The implicit measure of pre-attentive processing was electrodermal activity (EDA, specifically, skin conductance response rate). The variables manipulated were race attended, interloper race, and the interloper's possession of a weapon. There were no effects of interest on explicit reports of noticing. There was overwhelming inattentional blindness for the unexpected event (72-79%). For skin conductance, there was a 3-way interaction. However, explicit noticing moderated skin conductance response rate. Among those who did not notice the unexpected event, an attention set effect was found. As predicted, there was more electrodermal activity for an unexpected person whose race matched that of the attended group than an unexpected person whose race matched that of the ignored group. In addition, a possible priming effect was found. Participants attending the African American group had more electrodermal activity for an interloper with a gun than an interloper without a gun. It seemed the instructions to attend the African American team served as a prime for the weapon. A change blindness field study paradigm (based on Simons and Levin, 1998) was employed to explore the role of race categorization and the outgroup homogeneity effect on individuation of an interaction partner. The overall rate of change blindness for the switch of two confederates was high (=47%) regardless of the race of the pair switching. Limitations of the change blindness studies are discussed.

Results of the longitudinal analyses confirmed patients having better health outcomes (i.e., less pain, less disability) at discharge the more positive their outcome expectancies and the stronger their self-efficacy beliefs at admission. Stronger self-efficacy beliefs strengthened the positive outcome expectancy effect. Cross-sectional analyses examined influences of physical health, emotional well-being, and treatment experiences on both expectancy types at admission: Higher levels of both expectancy types were associated with better physical health. Additionally, stronger self-efficacy beliefs were related to less depressive symptoms; more positive outcome expectancies were related to stronger self-efficacy beliefs. Positive treatment experiences as through preoperative patient education were associated with stronger self-efficacy beliefs but less positive outcome expectancies.

"1233","An Empirical, Phenomenological Study: Being Joyful","B. Robbins takes us on a scholarly but lively review of the literature on joy, differentiating it from ""subjective well-being"" and introducing us to the debates about the nature of emotion. He cites not only research literature but the poet William Blake and philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Quentin Smith. He makes a case for the necessity of grounding qualitative research in experience, and spells out related philosophical considerations, including the character and role of hermeneutics. He guides us through the usual steps of data analysis in empirical phenomenological research. As he introduces his own study, Robbins explains that most qualitative researchers rely on participants' remote recall of events, which is dependent on their current state. Hence he introduces an innovation, using an adapted version of Scheier's psychotherapeutic imagery in movement method , to put participants in embodied touch with their experiences of being joyful. Specifically, he asked participants to create color drawings to indicate ""what it means to be joyful."" They verbally conveyed their felt sense of drawing (and of the drawing), and Robbins noted their expressive gestures throughout. Next, each participant role-played a particular story of joy from the past. Following these activities, the participants wrote descriptions of their experience of joy. From his analysis of these descriptions, Robbins presents 16 themes, each illustrated with data from all participants. A general structure then presents all the themes in their interrelations. Robbins closes the chapter with a return to the reviewed literature and a discussion of surprises to him and for our understanding of being joyful.

It builds on previous arguments that status, or epistemic modality, is a shifter that marks the speaker's commitment to a narrated event relative to the speech event; and that commitment should be understood as a kind of participant role. It details the complicated types of commitment events that are encoded and implicated in various contexts. It shows the ways in which multiple commitment events--inhabited by the speaker, addressee, and actor--combine in various contexts to serve complex functions, ranging from satiatives and dubitives to bluffatives and suprisitives. And it shows the ways in which these complicated, overlapping commitment events may be understood in terms of intentional states--from desire and worry to belief and hope. In this way, it grounds the 'possible worlds' of logicians and the 'intentional worlds' of psychologists in terms of participant roles; and it thereby reinterprets logical and psychological presumptions in terms of social and semiotic practices. In short, it shows the ways in which we are merely minding language when we talk about mind. Finally, while focused on the forms and functions of Q'eqchi'-Maya, it provides an analytic typology that may be used to analyze other languages (and other minds).

"1235","Anti-bullying intervention: Implementation and outcome","Background: The participant role approach represents a view of bullying as a group process in which bystanders often encourage the bullying or silently witness it, while little support is given to the victim (e.g. Salmivalli, Lagerspetz, Björkqvist, Österman, &amp; Kaukiainen, 1996). There is a discrepancy between students' attitudes (which are often against bullying) and their actual behaviour in bullying situations, and this may be an important factor contributing to the persistence of the problem. Aim: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of an anti-bullying intervention programme targeting the group as a whole. Class teachers who attended a 1-year training course carried out the interventions in school classes. The present evaluation of the project is based on multi-level modelling, assessing the programme effects after 12 months of intervention, utilizing a cohort longitudinal design with adjacent cohorts (Olweus &amp; Alsaker, 1991) also taking into account the degree of implementation of the programme. Sample: The intervention was implemented in 48 school classes (Grades 4, 5, and 6) from 16 Finnish schools, involving 1,220 children (600 girls and 620 boys). Method: The present report is based on questionnaire data collected at two assessment points during the project, assessing the frequencies of bullies and victims, the extent of observed and experienced bullying, students' attitudes and efficacy beliefs related to bullying, and their participant role behaviours (self- and peer-reported). Reports were collected from teachers about the concrete actions taken in order to compare the actual content of the intervention to what had been planned. Results: A positive impact of the intervention programme was found on several outcome variables (e.g. frequencies of bullies and victims, observed and experienced bullying, attitudes and efficacy beliefs, and to some extent, participant role behaviours). The intervention effects were found more often in Grade 4 than in Grade 5, and often only in schools with a high degree of implementation of the programme.

"1236","Subjective Probability Assessment in Decision Analysis: Partition Dependence and Bias Toward the Ignorance Prior","Decision and risk analysts have considerable discretion in designing procedures for eliciting subjective probabilities. One of the most popular approaches is to specify a particular set of exclusive and exhaustive events for which the assessor provides such judgments. We show that assessed probabilities are systematically biased toward a uniform distribution over all events into which the relevant state space happens to be partitioned, so that probabilities are ""partition dependent."" We surmise that a typical assessor begins with an ""ignorance prior"" distribution that assigns equal probabilities to all specified events, then adjusts those probabilities insufficiently to reflect his or her beliefs concerning how the likelihoods of the events differ. In five studies, we demonstrate partition dependence for both discrete events and continuous variables (Studies 1 and 2), show that the bias decreases with increased domain knowledge (Studies 3 and 4), and that top experts in decision analysis are susceptible to this bias (Study 5). We relate our work to previous research on the ""pruning bias"" in fault-tree assessment (e.g., Fischhoff et al. 1978) and show that previous explanations of pruning bias (enhanced availability of events that are explicitly specified, ambiguity in interpreting event categories, and demand effects) cannot fully account for partition dependence. We conclude by discussing implications for decision analysis practice.

"1237","Children's opinions on effective strategies to cope with bullying: The importance of bullying role and perspective","In order to find out what children would suggest as useful interventions to stop bullying, we designed a questionnaire administered to 311 children (155 boys and 156 girls; mean age=11 years). Thirty-six items were employed to ask children how effective, in their opinion, retaliation, nonchalance and assertiveness could be in stopping bullying. Items were presented to children from three different perspectives (imagine you are the victim, the bully or a witness). We used peer reports to assess children's role in bullying. Children were grouped into bullies, followers of the bully, defenders of the victims, outsiders, victims and those not involved. The strategy most frequently chosen by all children was to cope with bullying through assertiveness. Bullies considered retaliation effective more often than their classmates, especially when they adopted the perspective of the victim or witness. Bullies did not consider assertive strategies as efficient in stopping the bully. Defenders, outsiders, victims and children not involved, on the other hand, were very much in favour of strategies aimed at solving the conflict through nonchalance or assertiveness, especially when they imagined being the bully. Girls chose assertive strategies more often than boys and younger children preferred nonchalance more often than older children, who tended to choose retaliation more often. Suggestions for intervention are made.

"1238","The Importance of Considering the Effects of Perceived Group Assignment in Placebo-Controlled Trials","Comments on the article ""Is Acupuncture Analgesia an Expectancy Effect"" by Bausell et al (see record 2005-01831-007). It is argued that the report is not only a clinical trial showing that acupuncture is not better than placebo in reducing pain following dental surgery. Its importance goes beyond this finding as it highlights a novel way of thinking of and conducting clinical trials. The key finding of the study is that it examines the effect of perceived assignment of treatment, instead of the usual approach of looking at actual assignment. Patients who thought they had received the real acupuncture had significant improvements in pain compared with those who thought they had received the placebo. This study is another example of how clinical trials should be viewed from a theoretical perspective, on one hand, and how they should be conducted from a practical viewpoint, on the other hand. Because this distinction is never considered and explored in routine clinical trials, I believe that many erroneous conclusions about the therapeutic outcome could be avoided by using this approach.

"1239","Is acupuncture analgesia an expectancy effect? Preliminary Evidence Based on Participants' Perceived Assignments in Two Placebo-Controlled Trials","This purpose of this article is to contrast the analgesic efficacy of acupuncture following dental surgery with the analgesic effects based on the expectation of benefit in two independently conducted placebo-controlled trials evaluating acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy for dental surgery: Both trials used pain following dental surgery as the outcome variable, and both included a blinding check to ascertain patients' beliefs regarding which treatment they were receiving. Although no statistically significant analgesic effect was observed between the acupuncture and placebo groups, participants in both experiments who believed they received real acupuncture reported significantly less pain than patients who believed that they received a placebo. Patients 'beliefs regarding the receipt of acupuncture bore a stronger relationship to pain than any specific action possessed by acupuncture. These results also support the importance of both employing credible controls for the placebo effect in clinical trials and evaluating the credibility of those controls.

"1240","Belief can move mountains","Comments on the article ""Is Acupuncture Analgesia an Expectancy Effect,"" by Bausell et al (see record 2005-01831-007). This reanalysis of two sham controlled acupuncture trials showed that patients' beliefs about receiving either real or sham treatment were more important in determining the clinical outcome than any specific analgesic effect of the intervention. The best way to differentiate specific from nonspecific effects is to conduct placebo-controlled, preferably randomized trials. In many areas of medicine, we do not have a credible placebo. Patients' beliefs and expectations about osteopathy and an oral medication might differ. Expectations could significantly confound our results to the point of non-recognition. It follows that placebo control makes little sense without patient blinding. For dental pain, acupuncture was not better than sham, but patients' beliefs were a strong determinant of perceived pain. Even in conventional drug trials, beliefs and expectations created during the treatment period can confound the results.

"1241","Understanding adolescent participation in harassment: A social cognitive approach","Previous research utilized the Participant Role Questionnaire (Salmivalli et al., 1996) to delineate prevalence rates associated with different harassment behaviors among children. Investigators have not, however, psychometrically validated the scales measuring the various participant roles. In the first manuscript, exploratory factor analyses distinguished harassment behaviors (prosocial defenders, antisocial defenders, bullies, secondary aggressors, and outsiders) and identified meaningful group differences among them. Data were collected across two separate samples, with mean ages of 12 (N = 215) and 19 (N = 215). Results emphasized the similarity of participant roles in each age cohort, yet underscored certain developmental differences associated with participation in harassment. Although harassment continues to exist into adulthood, little research has examined bullying behavior among older adolescents, who are cognitively more advanced and for whom peer influences are especially powerful (Collins &amp; Laursen, 2000). In the second and third manuscripts, unique predictors of adolescents' behavior in aggressive interactions were identified. A social information processing model (Crick &amp; Dodge, 1994) was tested to assess the ways in which social schemas, aggression, victimization, interpersonal competence, empathy, perspective taking ability, personal distress (in the older cohort), and expectations of aggressive outcomes predicted the various participant roles among younger (Paper 2) and older (Paper 3) adolescents. This model provided a theoretical context within which bullying behaviors could be better understood. Participants completed self-report instruments and evaluated videotaped naturalistic aggressive interactions. These two methodologies demonstrated the value of using highly externally valid stimuli (i.e., naturalistic observations) to assess adolescents' evaluations of harassment. Because aggressive individuals have demonstrated problems with emotional regulation (Eisenberg, Wentzel, &amp; Harris, 1998), it was important to examine adolescents' on-line interpretation of aggressive interactions under more externally valid and therefore potentially arousing conditions. Overall, the results supported the relationships among prior experiences with aggression, the on-line interpretation of novel social cues, and current harassment behaviors. Findings also indicate that the new participant roles are consistent with existing theories of aggressive behavior and may reflect differences in emotional arousal and cognitive processing.

"1243","An exploration of affective priming as an indirect measure of food attitudes","During the last few years indirect measures of attitudes have been increasingly promoted. Because they are assumed to be less influenced by demand effects, these indirect measures would constitute a better basis to predict behaviour in some circumstances. In two studies, we examined the usefulness of the affective priming paradigm as an indirect measure of food likes and dislikes. Participants were asked to evaluatively categorize word targets, which were primed by individually selected positive and negative food pictures. The first experiment was a basic exploration of the usefulness of the affective priming paradigm to uncover food likes and dislikes, by making use of food stimuli that elicit strong evaluative reactions. The second experiment examined whether the paradigm can also be used in the context of weaker food (dis)likes. It could be demonstrated that both strongly (Experiments 1 and 2) and moderately (Experiment 2) evaluated food primes influenced the speed of responding to the positive and negative target words. No differential sensitivity for attitudes of moderate or extreme evaluative meaning could be demonstrated, however. The implications for future research and the applicability of this indirect index of food (dis)likes are discussed.

Teacher reports indicated Friendliness and Emotional Instability as the strongest distinguishing personality factors among the participant roles, followed by Conscientiousness and Energy. Higher levels of Emotional Instability and lower levels of Friendliness typified both Pro-bullies and Victims, relative to their peers. Victims were also low in Conscientiousness. Defenders exhibited high levels of Friendliness, whereas Introversion and Independence characterized Outsiders.

We analysed two questions on school experiences (participant role; coping strategies if bullied) and questions on workplace bullying (experiences of being bullied). We found a significant relationship between reported roles in school bullying, and experience of workplace victimization. The highest risk of workplace victimization was for those who were both bullies and victims at school (bully/victims), followed by those who were only victims. An analysis of relative risk of workplace bullying, given being a victim at school plus using various coping strategies, revealed an increased risk for the strategies 'tried to make fun of it', and 'did not really cope'. Women were at slightly higher risk of getting bullied at work, but there were no interactions with roles at school, and only one interaction with coping strategies.

Little research has examined how anchor numbers might bias choice. A rule for predicting the direction of the anchoring bias was developed and tested in an illustrative experiment. The rule was then used to predict that an anchor number should trigger a contrast effect in choices that follow an anchor number that is compared to a target quantity. Five experiments tested the prediction of numerically induced contrast and alternative accounts. As predicted, the experiments showed a suppressed contrast effect in choice, an effect that was apparent only after judgment was covaried from the relation between anchor number and choice. The experiments ruled out the explanations that the suppressed contract effect was due to a statistical artifact, demand effects, poor lay judgements, or a correction process. The central hypothesis of a numerically induced contrast effect was also ruled out. A remaining account is discussed: a ""phantom"" category coalesces when the target is compared to an irrelevant anchor number.

"1251","Alcohol use and alcohol-related consequences among first-year college students: An examination of intraindividual variability and the role of alcohol expectancies","While much of the attention focused on college alcohol use has been on the prevalence of heavy drinking and alcohol-related physical and behavioral harm, little is known about individual drinkers' experiences with alcohol, that is, their fluctuations in alcohol consumption and consequences over time. The present study used an intensive repeated measures within-person design to explore the extent to which intraindividual variation in the experience of alcohol-related consequences was a function of frequency of intoxication and the role alcohol expectancies played in those relationships. Across 10 consecutive weeks in one semester, 200 first-year college students completed weekly telephone interviews. Testing hypotheses based on harm reduction principles, hierarchical linear models were used to examine: (1) whether the concept of the point of diminished returns applied to first-year college students' alcohol use, and (2) whether there was an expectancy effect in the relationship between frequency of intoxication and the experience of alcohol-related consequences. Within-person (Level 1) analyses examined whether students' reports of heavy alcohol use were associated with a differential likelihood of experiencing positive and negative consequences compared to when moderate amounts of alcohol were consumed. Between-person (Level 2) analyses examined the extent to which within-person co-variation between alcohol use and consequences was moderated by alcohol expectancies. The results supported the general hypothesis of harm reduction, that negative consequences were minimized with low to moderate amounts of alcohol consumption. In contrast, positive consequences increased with more days of intoxication, not supporting the concept of the point of diminished returns in this population. Finally, an expectancy effect was found for moderate drinking weeks, but not for intoxicated drinking weeks. Students who felt it was more important to experience positive and to avoid experiencing negative consequences reported more positive and fewer negative consequences on weeks of moderate drinking. Discussion focuses on implications for harm reduction in general and programming targeted for the college population.

"1252","The impact of clients' expectancies on psychological treatment outcome","The current research had three main objectives. First, the primary goal of this research was to examine the role of expectancies within the context of psychological treatment. As predicted, evidence of an expectancy effect was found. More specifically, treatment gains associated with participating in assertiveness training were mediated by individuals' initial outcome expectancies. The second goal of this research was to investigate the nature of the change that resulted from altering people's expectations. This investigation yielded the following three findings. As anticipated, changes in assertiveness were evident on a self-perceived level, but not on an observable level (i.e., not on a behavioural rating scale or on friend-report measures). Also, preliminary support was provided for the notion that self-perceived increases in assertiveness are associated with improved mental health (i.e., higher self-esteem and lower depression). Finally, self-perceived behavioural gains were found to be long-lasting. Assertiveness levels reported at outcome had not declined 2 1/2 years later. The final goal of this research was to uncover the mechanism underlying the client expectancy effect. The results of this exploration revealed that the therapeutic context is not necessary for the occurrence of this phenomenon. Indeed, the magnitude of the relationship between expectancy and outcome was similar for assertiveness and control group participants. Reasons to account for the expectancy effect within the control condition remain uncertain. The results of this research failed to support the idea that the process of generating expectancies functioned to mobilize this effect. Moreover, these findings suggested that the increased assertiveness reported by control group members could not be attributed to the passage of time or to a compensatory process-i.e., a process whereby control group members come to perceive themselves as more assertive in order to compensate for their assignment to the non-therapeutic condition. The practical and theoretical implications of these results are discussed.

In the first block, 14% of the stimuli were the subject's phone number, 86% were other, meaningless numbers. Subjects responded yes or no, verbally and truthfully. In the second block, stimuli were dates, and the oddball was the subject's birthdate. Subjects again responded verbally, but dishonestly on about 50% of the trials and truthfully on the other 50%. Reaction times differed between the first and the second blocks, but not between the honest and dishonest trials of the second block. P300 amplitude was reduced in dishonest trials of the second block. Honest trials of both blocks had similar P300 amplitudes.

"1255","Automatic affective priming of recently acquired stimulus valence: Priming at SOA 300 but not at SOA 1000","In the present experiment, the use of the affective priming procedure as an indirect measure of stimulus valence was further explored. Results showed that aversively conditioned stimuli revealed their newly acquired valence in this priming procedure. As predicted, this effect was obtained at the short SOA (300 ms) but not at the long SOA (1000 ms). The significant SOA x Priming interaction suggests that the affective priming procedure is less or not affected by demand effects and (self-presentational) response strategies. This makes the affective priming effect an excellent and unobtrusive measure of affective valence and an interesting alternative to subjective rating scales in situations where demand effects might otherwise influence responding. The results are also related to recent research on conditioning models of the acquisition of anxiety disorders, and to research on the co-occurrence of expectancy learning and affective learning within these models.

"1256","Justifications for bullying among Japanese schoolchildren","Investigated the justifications for bullying as a function of the various roles that children assume in bullying. 54 boys and 46 girls (aged 12-14 yrs) participated. Contrary to expectations, most children judged bullying to be right or at least permitted regardless of their role in the episode. However, children with different types of involvement in bullying showed different justification strategies. In particular, bullies were more likely to blame the victims than were children assuming other roles. Gender differences were found in the justifications provided. Boys were more likely to blame the victims, whereas girls were more likely to engage in denial of injury. These results support the notion that justifications for bullying function to sustain bullying.

"1257","The impact of men's alcohol consumption on perpetration of sexual aggression","Epidemiological and experimental literature examining the link between men's alcohol consumption and perpetration of sexual aggression is reviewed. The following are included in the review: (1) associational studies that examine the correlation between typical alcohol consumption and history of sexual aggression perpetration; (2) event-level studies that examine the impact of alcohol consumption at the time of sexual assault; and (3) experimental studies that consider the impact of administered alcohol on men's responses to a sexual aggression analog. Experimental analog studies provide evidence of a proximal, pharmacological effect of alcohol on the likelihood of sexual aggression perpetration and more modest evidence supporting an alcohol expectancy effect. An integrative heuristic model of alcohol's distal and proximal effects on sexual aggression perpetration is proposed. Priorities for future research include greater specificity in measurement of sexual aggression, examination of alcohol's indirect effects on aggression through context, and consideration of mechanisms other than alcohol myopia in understanding alcohol's proximal effects.

"1258","Effects of three types of potentially biasing information on symptom severity judgments for major depressive episode","Examined the effects of potentially biasing information on judgments of symptom severity pertaining to the diagnosis of major depressive episode (MDE) in 2 experiments. In both studies, clinicians viewed videotapes of 2 actor-simulated patients responding to questions from a standardized diagnostic interview. Each of 3 independent variables was manipulated at 2 levels (clear cut vs near-threshold levels): (1) information for dysphoric mood and anhedonia, (2) information about a prior depressive episode, and (3) depressive nonverbal behavior (DNVB). 73 doctoral-level clinical psychologists (DCPs; mean age 47 yrs) participated in Study 1 and 51 DCPs (mean age 38.8 yrs) participated in Study 2. In Study 1, an expectancy effect was found for both patients such that prior information about a clear-cut history of depression resulted in lower rated severity of current symptoms. A halo effect was observed for 1 patient in Study 1 and both patients in Study 2: clear-cut DNVB resulted in greater rated severity for symptoms that should not have been affected (e.g., appetite/weight change, suicidal ideation). Clear-cut vs near-threshold information for the 2 essential criteria for MDE did not affect subsequent judgments in either study. Implications for diagnostic interviewing are discussed.

Likert-scale, post lesson questionnaires measured participant satisfaction with their roles, the communication, and equipment. An exit interview was conducted to obtain explanations for data trends. Intralesson communication was characterized by its short duration and low rate. It was predominantly CT-initiated, management oriented, neutral, and specific. Analysis of exit interviews revealed 3 themes to explain characteristics of and responses to communication, and the devices used to elicit it: CT/ST interpersonal and professional compatibility, role clarity, and commitment to perceived role function. The radio device/intervention did not differentiate communication characteristics from baseline or reversal phases; however, participants identified it as a discrete and immediate communication tool that promoted ST ""with-it-ness"" and autonomy.

"1260","Measure of beliefs about improvements in mood associated with exercise","Changes in mood following exercise are well documented; however, one particular limitation of research examining mood changes associated with exercise is that studies have not controlled for a possible expectancy effect. Given the difficulty associated with utilising a placebo control group in exercise settings and that no current questionnaires are available to measure beliefs concerning mood improvements during and after exercise, the present studies aimed to develop a suitable instrument for assessing these beliefs. In the first of these studies, 220 regular runners (mean age 27.6 yrs) were respondents in developing the new scale. A logical approach to test construction, as proposed by H. D. Hase and L. R. Goldberg in 1967, produced two scales of acceptable reliability: a five-item subscale to measure beliefs concerning mood improvements during running and a two-item subscale to measure beliefs about mood improvements following running. A second study, which involved the administration of these scales to 50 regular runners (mean age 26.6 yrs) after a 60-min treadmill run, indicated there were moderate associations between scores on these measures and mood changes during and after the run.

"1261","Emotion, moral perception, and character","This dissertation challenges the common belief that the value of emotions, if any, lies chiefly in their ability to motivate. It argues that emotions are vital to being able to properly evaluate what one encounters in the world. The dissertation focuses on moral evaluation, examining the role of emotion in determining moral character by way of the effect of emotion on moral perception. The term ""moral perception"" refers to an evaluative apprehension or ""taking in"" of a situation, where this apprehension includes a morally relevant aspect. Moral perceptions are a determinant of moral character, and are often the foundation of other determinants of moral character, namely moral beliefs and dispositions to act. The dissertation argues that emotions are related to moral character because, by directing and focusing our attention, they affect the makeup and experiential significance of these moral perceptions. This in turn affects the other determinants of moral character-namely moral beliefs and dispositions to act. The conclusion of this investigation is that having the right emotions is essential to good moral character because of the effects of emotion on moral perception. Devaluing emotion is misdirected because emotions are needed for a full understanding of what is significant, morally or otherwise, and because emotions accordingly have vital positive effects as well as potential negative effects. Emotions are an integral part of human functioning and flourishing, and we need the right ones at the right times to function well.

"1262","Semantic priming of expectancies among high- and low-restraint non-problem drinkers","Investigated the prediction that highly restrained non-problem drinkers have negative cue-absent drinking expectancies, and proposes a cognitive methodology for studying alcohol expectancies that is not influenced by self-report bias or subtle demand effects. For 118 college students, %RT% to an emotion name (e.g., sociable) was measured when that word was preceded by a drinking-related word (e.g., beer) and when preceded by a neutral word (e.g., book). 104 student drinkers were then administered the ""differentiated"" Restrained Drinking Scale, a drinking behavior questionnaire, and completed the semantic priming task. Results show that high- and low-restraint drinkers differed significantly in the extent and direction of priming to positive and negative emotional word targets, with the high-restraint drinkers taking longer to recognize positive words. The results suggest that, in the absence of an alcohol pre-load, highly restrained drinkers have weaker positive drinking expectancies than their less restrained peers. The priming procedure is seen to overcome problems of response manipulation that may be present in self-report measures of expectancies. Implications for the limit violation effect in relapse prevention (G. A. Marlatt, 1985) is discussed.

By focusing on excerpts taken from 2 American talk shows (the Oprah Winfrey show and the Geraldo Rivera show), the author explored distinguishing features of the talk show by comparing it with casual conversation and with institutional interaction. A distinguishing feature of the talk shows was their semi-institutional nature: they exhibited a mixture of characteristics pertaining to both casual conversation and institutional discourse in terms of discursive configuration and goal, participant role assignment and role switching, talk, and topic control. Similar discursive and institutional strategies tended to acquire different functions depending on whether they were used by show hosts or guests.

"1265","Interpersonal expectancy effects and the preference for consistency","Examined the degree to which a preference for consistency moderates interpersonal expectancy effects. 51 unacquainted male–female pairs (aged 17–28 yrs) engaged in a getting acquainted telephone conversation, with males believing they were conversing with either an attractive or a relatively unattractive female. Prior to the conversation, males completed the Preference for Consistency Scale (R. B. Cialdini et al, 1995; PFC). Tape recordings of the female's conversations were analyzed by 80 independent judges. Results show that judges rated females whose partners' believed they were attractive as more sociable, thus demonstrating the self-fulfilling prophecy or interpersonal expectancy effect. Males who believed that their partners were attractive elicited more sociable behavior from their partners than did those who believed their partners were unattractive. The relationship between attractiveness and sociability was decreased greatly after the getting acquainted conversation took place. The effect of the attractiveness manipulation dissipated as the males gained more information about their partners. Support for interactions between attractiveness condition and PFC was not found.

The dosage was 0.6 g/kg for males and 0.5 g/kg for females. In both baseline and performance days, participants were, randomized to 1 of 4 diesel simulator scenarios, each replicating a system failure in a power plant subsystem. A main effect for alcohol administration was found. In the alcohol condition, simulator performance time was almost twice as long (351 sec) as on the placebo condition (186 sec).

"1269","Experimental analogue of smoking cessation and relapse","Rates of relapse to smoking continue to plague clinicians and researchers despite decades of effort put forth toward understanding and treating smokers. Increasingly, first lapses to smoking following cessation attempts are being recognized as pivotal events in the relapse process. Once a person slips, and smokes a cigarette, the probability of relapse soars. Given the near inevitable progression to relapse following a lapse it is important to try to identify the underlying mechanisms. A number of plausible mechanisms have been posited to explain the progression to relapse including those involving pharmacological, cognitive and behavioral factors. The specific aim of the present study was to explore both pharmacological priming and expectancy as possible mechanisms influencing the progression from lapse to relapse. Employing a 3-cell variant of the balanced placebo design, we conducted an analogue experimental laboratory study on N=95 smokers contemplating quitting and exposed them to a ""first lapse,"" following a 48 hour period of abstinence. Through this design we isolated pharmacological priming and expectancy and examined the influence of these variables on time to relapse following the laboratory exposure or ""lapse."" Subjects were followed for 2 weeks post-exposure or until they smoked again. Statistical analyses using Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Models failed to support apriori hypotheses. Although expected, priming did not lead to quicker progression to relapse. In fact, we found no effect of pharmacological priming on time to relapse. Expectancy did not affect survival rates when examined using all subjects across the full time period. A large proportion (.80) of the sample relapsed within the laboratory exposure day. Comparisons of time to relapse within that day alone revealed an expectancy effect. Expecting exposure to nicotine cigarettes led to longer survival than expecting exposure to placebo cigarettes, regardless of actual nicotine content. Findings from this study taken together with prior work suggest that behavioral exposure combined with cognitive influences may be the primary factors involved in the lapse to relapse progression. Implications are discussed in terms of the study's strengths and weaknesses as well as future directions.

"1270","Mechanisms and strategies for rephrasing","Reviews research into rephrasing and describes a model-theoretic mechanism for rephrasing between sentential forms. The results of a study of effects of task format are outlined, which allow a test between competing proposals for a general reasoning mechanism. The kinds of strategies that can be invoked during rephrasing are also reviewed. The role of thematic content is then discussed, and the integration of thematic information at 2 points in the construction of a mental representation of sentences is considered. In accounting for contextual and task demand effects, it is suggested that reasoning in general, and model theory in particular, might be reconceptualized as problem solving. Model construction offers a fundamental mechanism for developing the reasoning space, and is a continuous process rather than simply a response to premise information. Minimal completion operates as general constraint, limiting model construction and strategy choice to the minimum required to satisfy the task demands (or goal state). Strategies (e.g., searching for alternatives) are applied to constrain or expand the reasoning space. They enable the application of operators (e.g., ""reading off' model sets, applying inference rules, or invoking heuristics) that generate solution components.

The sample population for this study included 142 participants in 33 MDT meetings conducted in 15 Nebraska school districts. The results of this study indicated the following: (1) The majority of MDT participants reported that the were satisfied with the outcomes of the meetings. (2) Both participation and expectation levels of MDT participants were related to their reported levels of satisfaction. (3) The roles individuals served in the MDT meetings were related to their reported levels of participation in the meetings, but not to satisfaction levels as they were defined in the context of this study. (4) A wide range of participation levels were reported by the classroom teachers, in comparison to more consistent responses among the other four role groups. (5) The combination of expectations and participation levels significantly increased the ability to predict levels of satisfaction. (6) Satisfaction levels were not related to the confirmation by the MDT of the child's disability. Based on the results of this study, this researcher concluded that the premises of Role, Expectancy, and Participatory Decision-Making Theories did apply to the context of the MDT meetings. The following recommendations were made: (1) Replication of this study is needed with a larger sample. (2) The wide variation in reported levels of participation among teachers is worthy of further study. (3) Further research involving the direct observation of MDT members' participation and interaction is needed to determine if this self-report data accurately represents the actual levels of involvement among different MDT participants. (4) Longitudinal case studies are needed to determine if the recommendations of the MDT are actually being followed by the school staff in development of the IEP and if by following these recommendations school staff can demonstrate any improvement in the student's performance.

"1273","Participant role approach to school bullying: Implications for intervention","Discusses practical implications of the participant role approach to bullying in schools. This view looks at bullying as a group phenomenon that is largely enabled and maintained by members of a school class taking on different participant roles (e.g., assistants or reinforcers of the bully, or outsiders). Since peers are involved in bullying in different ways, and seem to be powerful moderators of behavior in a school class, the author recommends this peer group power should also be utilized in putting an end to bullying. In interventions targeting the whole peer group, it has been peers that, after initial adult encouragement and training, take action against bullying. This happens informally, in their spontaneous everyday interactions. Peers can also be utilized in formal helper roles as peer counselors. The focus of counseling could be shifted from supporting the victims toward working with students in other participant roles.

It is noted that Honorton et al decided that evidence of an ESP/extraversion correlation was to be found only in those studies where the test of extraversion was administered after the ESP test was given and the results known. They speculated on 2 possible mechanisms for this effect: (1) awareness of ""success"" or ""failure"" may lead Ss to later perceive themselves as more extraverted or introverted, or (2) the experimenter expectancy effect. The current authors regard the 1st mechanism as unlikely in the extreme for most good personality tests. It is argued that the experimenter effect mechanism could just as easily be raised in the case of successful extraversion/ESP experiments where the personality test was administered before the ESP test.

"1275","The role of expectancy in treatment efficacy: The use of a therapeutic ""frame"" to enhance performance. (placebo)","The discussion of so-called ""placebo"" healing phenomena in the medical and psychology literature has been muddied by definitional controversies and hampered by the underlying assumptions of the models used to understand these phenomena. Response Expectancy (RE) theory (Kirsch, 1990), which attempts to overcome the dualism of the prevailing biomedical model, offers potentially useful ways of accounting for some of the data on placebo phenomena. Previous research has provided some support for RE theory, but chiefly in domains that involved purely subjective outcomes such as pain perception and hypnotizability. The present study employed Frank's (1961) conceptualization of healing as a persuasive process and the concepts of RE theory to generate testable hypotheses about the efficacy of expectancies as healing agents in their own right. This study used a true experimental design to evaluate an expectancy manipulation by means of objective outcome measures. The aim of the study, which involved 128 college students, was to evaluate the ability of a set of procedures framed as treatment to induce performance-enhancing positive expectations in a context analogous to psychotherapy. A set of identical procedures framed as an assessment procedure served as the control condition. The procedures framed as treatment were not found to enhance performance above the performance gains demonstrated in the control condition, despite large increments in expectancy for the ""treatment frame"" group. The act of measuring participants' expectancies, a methodology that has been recommended in the expectancy literature, was found to significantly enhance performance, a finding that raises questions of mechanism and calls into question the soundness of this methodology as a manipulation check. The results of the present study show that expectancy measurement, however valid, has a powerful effect on participants. In addition it raises questions about what mediates the performance-enhancing effects of expectancy measurement and whether that mechanism can itself be viewed as an expectancy effect. It is possible that an expectancy manipulation can work as a treatment only for a truly distressed population. Future research might productively target such a population if the difficult ethical issues raised by such a study could be satisfactorily addressed.

"1276","Young children's moral and social conflicts: The relationships between judgments of matched practical and hypothetical events","This study investigated moral reasoning about actual and hypothetical conflicts. Children aged 3-5 years were observed in naturally occurring conflicts and interviewed about what had happened and why, their judgments of intentionality, whether a rule applied, the ability to describe how both the self and other felt, and their moral judgments and justifications of the event. One month later, hypothetical stories constructed to match the child's prior conflict, in terms of content and context, were presented and the children were again interviewed, as in the practical condition. Results indicated both consistencies and differences in the children's construals of the two matched events, but general predictions regarding the methodological importance of matching hypothetical stories to familiar, real world events were supported. Contrary to predictions, role as an initiator or recipient did not influence judgments or event construals, except in causal attributions. In all analyses, events were significantly judged ""not ok"", regardless of condition or participant role. Results are discussed in relation to prior research on moral judgments of hypothetical vignettes and implications are drawn for theory and research on the relationship between practical and hypothetical moral reasoning.

"1277","Bullying as a group process: An adaptation of the participant role approach","Recent years have seen a shift in bullying research from a dyadic focus on the characteristics of the Bully and Victim to the recognition of bullying as a whole group process, with the majority of children playing some kind of role. This study uses a shortened adaptation of the Participant Role Scale approach to identify these roles in 193 children (aged 7–10 yrs). Four main factors were identified, indicating that the adapted scale role remains a reliable way of distinguishing the Victim, Defender of the victim, and Outsider roles both from each other and from roles involved in bullying others. Progress in the measurement of bullying as a group process and the success of intervention strategies may depend on finding clearer distinctions between ringleader bullied and the children that help them or reinforce their behavior, using the Participant Role Scale approach to mobilize peer pressure and isolate ringleaders from their social support.

"1278","A longitudinal look at teacher expectations and differential teacher treatment","The longitudinal course and implications of teacher expectations and differential treatment (as perceived by children) were examined in two related studies of first, third, and fifth graders. Differential treatment refers to regular, observable differences in teacher behavior that favor high over low achievers and convey teacher expectations to children. Teacher expectations are conceptualized as risk factors for children: when held rigidly and manifested in salient differential treatment, they may magnify differences in children by enhancing outcomes for high achievers over low, beyond what prior predictors would suggest. That is, they may produce an expectancy effect. Using two independent data samples, Study One results indicated that classroom differences in the degree of differential treatment, identified from children's aggregated reports, show long-term (fall to spring) reliability in third and fifth grade, but not first. Methodological implications are discussed. Results also demonstrated predictive validity by linking classroom differences to long-term stability in teacher expectations and children's individual reports of differential treatment. Generally, greater stability was found in classrooms where differential treatment was salient. Given these findings, vulnerability to teacher expectancy effects may be greater in these classrooms because highly stable expectations are coupled with differential treatment that is clearly observed by students throughout the year. Study Two evaluated a path model of teacher expectancy effects on children's ending reading achievement and children's achievement expectations. Classroom differences in the degree of perceived differential treatment and children's age were both related to effect magnitude. Stronger teacher expectancy effects on ending achievement were found in classrooms where differential treatment was salient, except in first grade, where moderate effects were found in all. Significant teacher expectancy effects on children's own expectations were found only in fifth grade classrooms where differential treatment was pronounced. A significant age-related decline in teacher expectancy effects on ending achievement was interpreted as evidence for greater sustaining rather than magnifying teacher expectancy effects in older children. Significant effects on children's own expectations in fifth grade high-salience differential treatment classrooms suggest the start of an increasingly important role for children's expectations in models of teacher expectancy effects in later grades.

Ss completed the Creative Behavior Inventory (D. Hocevar, 1979) and the Core Alcohol and Drug Survey (C. A. Presley et al, 1994). A majority of Ss were female (56.7%), and students identified themselves as 92.9% Caucasian, 2.4% Native American, 1.8% African American, and 3.0% other ethnic group or groups. The age at which students first used specific drugs was negatively or negligibly related to creative achievement, and past use of drugs was generally not significantly correlated with creative achievement. However, limited evidence of a social expectancy effect was found (i.e., past creative achievement was correlated positively with current marijuana and female tobacco use and negatively with male alcohol use).

"1280","Improving credibility of instructions in the balanced placebo design: A misattribution manipulation","This study tested the plausibility of two misattribution strategies designed to reduce the conflict between experimenter instructions and internal cues of drunkenness. 42 participants (mean age 24.1 yrs; blood alcohol content = .055) were told that they received no alcohol, with internal cues of drunkenness said to be produced by a (sham) second drug, a (placebo) tachistoscopic display, or no misattribution given. It was found that the placebo drug group reported less alcohol intoxication without reporting less physical impairment than the control or tachistoscopic groups. Doubt of instructions was expressed more frequently in the control group than in the placebo drug group. Mean time to first reported doubt of experimenter instructions was longer for the placebo drug group. A manipulation check designed to account for demand effects indicated that instituting the pharmacologic misattribution increased the success of the manipulation over the control group. The authors conclude that providing a credible attribution for internal symptoms of drunkenness makes experimenter's instructions more credible, improving the validity of the antiplacebo cell of the balanced placebo design.

"1281","Pulmonary function and dyspnea/suffocation theory of panic","Presents a discussion of pulmonary function and panic attacks in the context of respiratory psychophysiology. The dyspnea/suffocation theory of panic is contrasted with the false suffocation alarm theory. The distinction between dyspnea and suffocation is emphasized. The discussion is followed by a critical comparison of 2 recent studies on pulmonary function and panic. G. J. Asmundson and M. B. Stein (see record 1994-25667-001) reported an association between forced expiratory flow rate in panic disorder patients and the severity of panic-related symptoms. They interpreted their findings as support for the dyspnea/suffocation theory of panic since severity of dyspnea is a consequence of pulmonary function. P. H. Spinhoven et al (see record 1995-40637-001) failed to replicate the findings of Asmundson and Stein. The present paper provides a critical analysis of the study by Spinhoven et al and concludes that the failed attempt to replicate may have been a consequence of a flawed methodology and a statistical anomaly. A recommendation is made that future attempts to replicate should pay special care to avoid the possibility of experimenter-demand effects.

A model of case application was used to enhance partner acquisition of targeted skills and knowledge, thereby addressing perceived concerns in this area. Participants including teachers, teacher aides, and speech pathologists completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires measuring skills, knowledge, and concerns. Data were analyzed on the basis of participant role to determine the significance of change between groups. Results suggest that the professional development program was effective. Teachers and teacher aides reported increased skills and knowledge, accompanied by reduced concerns. Speech pathologists indicated minimal change in either area.

Further, it is argued that even if the speculation that high publicly self-conscious scorers are more responsive to experimental demand effects than those of high private scorers, it is not clear how that would change the conclusion that high scorers on public self-consciousness are more likely to bias performance ratings than those scoring high on private self-consciousness.

"1284","Performance and the service encounter: An exploration of narrative expectations and relationship management in the outdoor leisure market","This study of rockclimbers and outdoor leisure consumers, manufacturers and retailers, sets out to discover the nature and outcomes of the consumer/producer relationship centered around the retail setting. Initial theoretical views on the self, participant role, performance and communitas (communitas emerges from the sharing of ritual experience which transcends the mundane nature of daily life). The establishment of communitas between participants is explored as a background to the discussion. Data collection involved participant observation, in-depth interviews and a study of both commercially and consumer generated secondary materials (climbing club literature for example). The researchers identified an environment in which temporary leisure identities were supported and at times modified by the retail relationships and were embedded in a rich sub-cultural narrative. Postmodern concepts pertaining to the consumption of place and space corresponded with the observational data, to the extent that recommendations for retailers are less overtly managerial, and more about facilitating the consumer's ownership of the spaces and relationships within them.

The measures used were the Participant Role Questionnaire and an applied version of the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale. A cluster analysis was performed to form groups with similar SC profiles. The ultimate solution consisted of 6 clusters, which differed significantly from each other in how much their members tended to bully others, assist the bully, reinforce the bully, and withdraw from bullying situations. Adolescents who tended to bully others typically had high social and physical SC, although their view of themselves was rather negative on the other SC domains. Youngsters who tended to assist or reinforce the bully either had an SC structure similar to that of the bullies, or they scored low on all SC domains. Withdrawing from bullying situations was most typical of adolescents who had at least average scores on behavioral and family-related SC, although they did not perceive themselves as very competent in other areas. Adolescents with low social and physical SC or low SC on all domains were victimized most, although defending the victims was most typical of girls and boys who considered themselves competent in all areas.

"1287","Teacher expectations: Implications for school improvement","This chapter attempts to illustrate ways in which teacher expectancy effect literature continues to have an enduring impact on the broader social psychology of education. In particular, it attempts to show how work on teacher expectations can be seen as central to the interests of the school effectiveness and school improvement movement. What teachers expect of their students will play an important part in the determination of student motivation. However, it is insufficient to simply regard teacher expectations as ranging from high to low. It is the prescriptive element of teacher expectations that has a special significance for changing student outcomes. The chapter attempts to show how prescriptive expectations touch upon a range of teacher expectations and beliefs that influence the extent to which they are likely to see desired changes as being possible. Effective schools are 'can do' schools with 'can do' teachers. The challenge for future social psychological research within the classroom is to demonstrate just what a 'can do' school and teacher are and the ways in which these positive elements can be enhanced.

To identify the peer networks of the Ss they were asked to answer the question ""Which children in your class are friends with each other?"" Results showed that Ss who tend to behave in either similar or complementary participant roles in situations of bullying formed networks with each other. Bullies, assistants and reinforcers belonged to larger networks than did defenders, outsiders and victims. Ss outside the networks were most likely to be victims. It was concluded that behavior in bullying situations is one feature around which the peer networks in school classes are organized and strategies against bullying should focus not only on individual children but on the wider social context.

In Exp 1, the requested compensation was manipulated across participants. In Exp 2, anchors were operationalized as the strength of the legal evidence. Both monetary and causal anchors systematically influenced judgments of the probability that the defendant caused the plaintiff's injuries, compensation awarded, and perceptions of the litigants. The results indicate that anchoring occurs in legal applications, and that plaintiffs would do well to request large compensation awards. In addition, anchors expressed on one scale affected judgments expressed on another scale. This cross-modality anchoring stands in contrast to previous studies. Finally, these anchoring effects are unlikely to be explained by either demand effects or perceived relevance of the anchor.

The overall results showed that a test expectancy effect was not obtained when a voluntary selection in strategies was prohibited, but was found for subjects not instructed in the use of any particular strategy. It is also shown that the subjects could predict correctly that the items studied with associative rehearsal would be recalled more successfully at the final test than when they were studied with rote repetition. A superiority of associative rehearsal for prediction was not found when the subjects used only one type of rehearsal, but was found when they were not given the immediate test. The results suggest that the expectancy effect can be explained in terms of subjects' intentional shifts of strategies based on their metacognitive assessment of such strategies.

Several empirical findings in the psi and psychological literature made after Hudson's time are shown to be consistent with the model, including (1) hypnosis as a facilitator of psi, (2) experimenter effects, (3) artistic creation, and (4) the placebo or expectancy effect. The effect of disbelief (sheep/goat effect) and the quality of extraversion on psi are also discussed. Some testable predictions derived from Hudson's model are considered with a review of pertinent literature. Hudson's subjective mind is shown to be compatible with R. Allison's (1980) concept of ""Inner Self"" and ""Inner Self Helper"" and with E. R. Hilgard's (1986) concept of the ""hidden observer.""

However, both the experimental and placebo groups received the placebo. Mothers and sons were videotaped while interacting together and each mother was then questioned about the interaction. Mothers in the sugar expectancy condition rated their children as significantly more hyperactive.

"1302","The effects of interpersonal verbal behaviour of varying participant role in initial dyadic conversations","Used the Verbal Interaction Analysis System (VIAS) to investigate the effects of manipulating the nature of dyadic interactions among 24 undergraduate women (aged 18–42 yrs). Repeated measures within dyads were used to extend the manipulation of A. Ralph (see record 1991-21243-001), who noted an effect across dyads. Independent ratings of global interpersonal behavior were negatively correlated with verbal behavior (VB) that discouraged topic maintenance. Results support the hypothesis that competence in interpersonal interactions is substantially determined by the effects that one participant's verbal utterances have on those of the other participant, and vice versa. Results also suggest that it is unproductive to consider the VB of one person outside the context of the interaction with the other person in a dyadic exchange. The need to adapt social skills assessment measures and training procedures to take account of these findings is discussed.

The parents of these students were surveyed to obtain family background materials, and were asked about their expectancies of their children's future careers and future educational achievements. Fifth-graders with high career (professional) expectancy fathers tended to have better developed cognitive abilities; however, there was no career expectancy effect on 1st graders. Children of fathers with high school-achievement expectancy tended to have better developed cognitive skills; this effect was stronger for 5th graders than 1st graders. There was a trend that the higher the educational level of the fathers, the higher their expectancy for their children.

The interaction of the expectancies concurrently predicted smoking urge under stress, which, in turn, predicted subsequent smoking. The interaction of posttreatment expectancies prospectively predicted smoking status 3 mo after treatment, although the coping benefits of smoking expectancy effect was reversed. Expectations about coping ability increased and expectations about the coping benefits of smoking decreased as a function of participating in a smoking cessation program.

"1311","Encoding pictures in scene contexts: Does task demand influence effects of encoding congruity?","Three experiments examined the role of task demand in accounting for the effect of encoding congruity in levels-of-processing research. The effect of encoding congruity refers to the likelihood of remembering items associated with yes responses better than items associated with no responses. Ss made yes responses if target pictures were congruous with prior scene contexts or if targets and prior contexts were incongruous. Congruous contexts yielded better incidental cued recall and name recognition than incongruous ones, independently of response type. However, effects of encoding congruity and response type were not significant for picture recognition. It is suggested that the effect of encoding congruity depends on the ability to integrate target items into consistent contexts. However, encoding congruity facilitates remembering pictures' identity, but not their visual details. The relevance of the results to scene schema research is also discussed.

Ss with greater need for social approval and greater nonverbal decoding ability are more susceptible to bias. In this study, each E administered a photo-rating task under positive or negative expectancies to 4 Ss, each of whom also interacted with 3 other Es. All 5 personality moderator hypotheses were tested.

The mother–observer relationship is described as one of transference. Within this transference, the observer seemed to be the mother of the one observed. The effects of this transference on the observed mother's unconscious conflict with her own mother due to epilepsy are described. Given transference in the mother–observer relationship, doubts are raised as to the tenability of the attitude of distance and noninterference prescribed for the observer. The role of the observer is said to be a participant role. This poses the epistemological problem of interference of the observer with the observed.

Our findings indicated that when our subjects were relieved of the demand to report an estimate of the amount drunk consistent with the experimenter's instructions, subjects' estimates were more in line with their actual drink content. On the basis of our findings, and the similarity of our study to earlier studies using the balanced-placebo design, we wonder whether subjects in earlier studies did not suspect a deception in their experimenter's instructions but reported estimate consistent with instruction so that they would not ""ruin"" the experiment. The comments of Collins and Searles are thought provoking and caution against overgeneralizing our results. Nevertheless, our findings at least raise the possibility of a demand confound in balanced-placebo studies, and this deserves further empirical exploration and consideration.

"1332","The effects of alcohol and anger on interest in violence, erotica, and deviance","Alcohol expectancy (expect alcohol vs expect tonic), alcohol content (receive alcohol vs receive tonic), and anger provocation (provoked vs unprovoked) were factorially crossed to investigate their influence on male interest in viewing 4 types of slides: neutral, erotic, violent, and violent-erotic. Ss were 64 male undergraduates. Ss' ad lib viewing times were unobtrusively measured. Alcohol expectancy emerged as the most potent of the manipulated variables, facilitating viewing times for the nonneutral slides and overriding the impact of alcohol content. This expectancy effect was more pronounced with the violent-erotic slides than with slides that were violent only. Within the violent-erotic slides, the expectancy effect was greater for a highly deviant subset of slides. Expect-alcohol Ss also reported more sexual arousal than did expect-tonic controls. Anger provocation increased verbal aggressiveness and reduced slide viewing. The role of cognitive processes in mediating alcohol effects on negatively sanctioned psychosocial behaviors is discussed.

"1333","Multidisciplinary examinations of the ""causes"" of crime: The case of the link between alcohol and violence","Contends that direct causal relationships between alcohol consumption and aggression and/or crime are simplistic and should be viewed from a multidisciplinary standpoint. It is noted that alcohol is metabolized in the body into several products (e.g., acetaldehyde, tetrahydroisoquinolines) that may be the factors that change behavior rather than alcohol per se. There is also an ""expectancy effect,"" exhibited in studies by Ss who think they are drinking alcohol as well as those who are drinking alcohol. The concepts of crime and aggression are surrounded by complications: In varying cultures, time, or contexts, the same action may be regarded as criminal or legitimate. It is concluded that alcohol can be linked with aggression and crime, but it should not be assumed to be the direct cause of violent behavior.

"1334","Images contain what the imager put there: A nonreplication of illusions in imagery","Recent studies by B. Wallace (see PA, Vol 72:328 and 5747) showing illusions in imagery appear to contradict the distinction between perception, for which a percept may not correspond to the stimulus, and imagery, which represent what the imager intended and therefore cannot be misunderstood. To test Wallace's claims, the present authors asked 18 community college students to complete a questionnaire concerning imaged and actual illusions and to respond to the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ). Results show that Ss who imagined the configuration of a standard geometric illusion did not yield a reliable illusory effect. This was true for Ss with and without vivid visual imagery (as assessed by the VVIQ). These results are in clear contrast to data reported by Wallace. It is suggested that previous demonstrations of imagery illusion may reflect guessing or demand effects.

It is concluded that at the heart of the Rosenthal effect is the pretention of experimenters to control all variables and, in particular, to control themselves, the experimenters, totally. The author argues that if interaction in the experimental situation is necessary and not completely controllable, an observational technique should be used to audit the experimental procedure.

Ss completed a task in 2 different sessions 1 wk apart. Ss in each condition were divided into 2 groups according to the median algebraic difference between their task performance scores of Sessions 1 and 2. Between the 2 sessions, Ss completed ratings of themselves and their teachers. Results show that changes in self- and teacher ratings were larger in the expectancy than in the control condition. The group of Ss that evidenced large behavior changes between the 1st and 2nd sessions changed their ratings of themselves and their teachers more than did the groups showing small behavior changes. Traits such as trustworthiness, responsibility, loyalty, and diligence were related to changes in Ss' self-concepts that resulted from behavior being modified by the teacher's expectancy.

Exp I investigated the impact of S's level of expectation by trichotomizing 46 Ss into high, moderate, and low expectancy groups based on their responses to a sugar expectancy questionnaire. Ss in each group rated the symptoms experienced every 5 min for 30 min after being randomly assigned to sugar water, saccharin water, or a no-challenge control group. Results reveal no difference among the groups in rated symptoms that could be accounted for as a result of an expectancy effect. In Exp II, 44 Ss completed an other- and a self-expectancy questionnaire that assessed beliefs about the impact of sugar and caffeine. Results reveal that Ss believed sugar and caffeine to have a significantly greater impact on others than on themselves. Exp III investigated the possibility that if Ss were given an explicit expectancy the expectancy effect would be attained. 45 randomly assigned Ss received either a positive, negative, or no expectancy regarding the impact of ingesting sugar. Results reveal no difference between Ss' ratings of the symptoms they were experiencing following ingestion of sugar water as a function of the expectancy given.

According to a balanced-placebo design, Ss were told they were either consuming alcohol or placebo. The task of one confederate was to initiate conversation and distract Ss from monitoring their state of intoxication while the 2nd confederate's role was to antagonize Ss at a prescribed time. Sessions were videotaped and rated for frequency of positive and negative interactions and Ss completed rating scales evaluating each other. Results fail to show an expectancy effect on any measures; however, there was an alcohol effect seen in an increase in negative interactions as well as positive interactions and a significant expectancy × alcohol interaction for negative ratings of the provocative confederate. Results show that in those groups where the manipulation matched the expectation, alcohol-told alcohol and placebo-told placebo, the confederate was seen more negatively than in the mixed groups. An attributional explanation for the results is offered, and the generality of the alcohol-expectancy phenomenon questioned.

In one token-assignment task, Ss were required to respond after watching silent enactments of transitive events; in the other, Ss heard verbal descriptions of similar events. Comparison of individual response patterns across the tasks revealed that, whereas 62 of the 72 Ss could identify the actor in the nonverbal task, 19 Ss subsequently failed to perform as well when they had to base their judgment on active sentences in the verbal task. Of the 44 Ss who responded accurately in the verbal token-assignment task, only 34 responded consistently correctly when required to act out those sentences.

Both psi phenomena and the experimenter expectancy effect (R. Rosenthal and L.

Despite their similarity, the 2 phenomena have been treated as radically different and have radically different reputations. The possibility that psi and the Rosenthal effect may be a single phenomenon is explored.

Expectancy was manipulated by varying the probability that the stimulus would appear at the center of an imaginary circle rather than along the perimeter. Although both age groups responded consistently faster to stimuli presented in expected locations than to stimuli presented in unexpected locations, this expectancy effect was larger for the children than it was for the college students. In a 3rd experiment with 16 5-yr-olds, 16 8-yr-olds, and 12 undergraduates, these results were replicated using a luminance-detection task. It is concluded that children as well as adults are able to expand or contract the breadth of their attentional focus in accordance with task demands and that there is a developmental change in the efficiency with which a stimulus presented in an otherwise empty field can be located.

It promotes active learning by shifting players into the participant role. Each strategic movement generates a visible response. Moreover, the immediacy of reciprocal responses reduces the sense of distance between the player's efforts and successes. External stimuli are controlled to focus and define exploration and problem solving. Challenges are matched to players' developmental levels to create a psychological sense of flow. Relatedly, the player gains status, self-determination, and sustained enjoyment. It is contended that designing a humane, productive learning environment and a successful video game parlor draws essentially on the same considerations: one's beliefs about human nature, the nature of learning, and the interest and needs of students (players).

"1355","Vicious circles: The self and the rhetoric of emerging and unfolding","Discusses cyclical psychodynamics, so called because it locates the heart of the psychodynamic process not in the patient's preserved past but in the cycles that past events set in motion. Central to this point of view is the theory that the seemingly infantile wishes and ideas that are revealed in psychoanalytic work persist not in spite of the person's present reality but precisely because of it. Differences in the importance of anxiety and repression in neo-Freudian and cyclical psychodynamic theories are discussed. It is noted that the ""emerging"" or ""unfolding"" of the patient's psychological life is a result of the observer-participant role of the therapist. Therefore, assuming a nonintrusive neutral stance during these experiences is no less likely to influence ensuing events than any other way of participating. If the therapist can abandon the quixotic quest for neutrality, and the corollary rhetoric of emerging or unfolding, he/she can then try to help in a broader range of ways. The cyclical psychodynamic approach is an attempt to return to the contextual core of neo-Freudian theory. The broader theme of active intervention in the context of psychoanalytic exploration, and the synergistic therapy this suggests, offers important possibilities for revitalizing interpersonal theory and psychoanalysis.

""Hysteresis"" revisited","Studied the effects of expectancy and variation in task demand on the rate of human information transmission. 24 female undergraduates performed an 8-choice key-pressing task, attempting to match characters singly under both increasing and decreasing demand. Results support previous research indicating that the relationship between the rate of information an individual is able to transmit and task demand depends, at least in part, on the temporal history of demand. When a relatively high level of demand was imposed, performance failed to recover at the expected rate as demand was reduced. However, this ""hysteresis"" effect occurred even when a cue was provided to indicate clearly that a reduction in task demand was imminent, suggesting that an overload of short-term memory, rather than an individual's erroneous expectations regarding demand, is primarily responsible for the effect.

"1359","Effect of experimenter's expectancy in relation to type and structure of the experimental task","Investigated variables related to the mediation and generality of the experimenter expectancy effect. It was hypothesized that the type of experimental task, defined by the presence or absence of factual or emotional components, and the structure of the task, defined by the ambiguity that the S faces in making the judgments, exert a moderating influence on the transmission of the experimenter's expectancy. Exp I employed a replication of R. F. Rosenthal and K. L. Fode's (1963) procedure and a numerosity estimation task, and Exp II used a modified Rosenthal replication and modified numerosity estimation. 40 male experimenters ran 154 female Ss in both conditions across each of these studies. Ss rated photographs of faces for success or failure in the Rosenthal replications and the number of dots/stimulus card in the numerosity estimations, with positive and negative expectancies induced in the former and over- and under-estimation biases in the latter. It is concluded that the type of task and task-structure are crucial variables for the transmission of the experimenter's expectancy.

"1360","Overt expression of experimenter expectancies, interaction with subject expectancies, and performance on a psychomotor task","Subsequent to success or failure experience, 48 undergraduates attempted a psychomotor task in order to escape or avoid an aversive stimulus (tone). Their attempts at solving the task over 24 trials were made in the presence of S-experimenters (12 other undergraduates), each of whom had expectancies instilled regarding the solution to the task. The job of the S-experimenters was to ""offer information"" on every 3rd trial as Ss attempted to solve the task. Results show that the expectancies of S-experimenters were communicated to Ss via periodic comments and that these expectancies differentially affected Ss' performance on the task. Prior experience on a similar task failed to produce significant differences on task performance. Results are discussed from the perspective of using the overt, explicit communication of expectancies as a means for exploring the phenomenon of the experimenter expectancy effect.

"1361","The Personality Research Form as a therapy outcome measure of social behavior","Examined the efficacy of the Personality Research Form (PRF) as an outcome measure for interventions designed to increase social competence. In the 1st study ( N  = 83 undergraduates), the degree to which PRF scales can predict criteria frequently used in social skills training outcome research was examined, and the PRF was shown to be sensitive to such criteria. The 2nd study ( N  = 24 undergraduates) assessed the relative degree to which the PRF scales and more frequently used outcome measures, including the above criteria, are affected by factors nonspecific to social skills training interventions (suggestion for improvement). While 3 PRF scales were affected significantly, demand effects were much more pervasive on the other measures, which suggests that those measures can be used to obtain valid estimates of treatment effects only when experimental control of nonspecific effects is possible. Two PRF scales, Affiliation and Exhibition, were shown to be sensitive to criteria and resistant to demand effects and as such may be useful as outcome measures in noncontrolled clinical settings.

"1362","Personal versus situational determination of anticipation and control of the occurrence of stressful life events","A wide variety of laboratory and clinical studies have indicated that stressful events are most harmful when they are perceived as uncontrollable. However, these studies diverge on the question of whether perceptions of control of stressful events are determined by environmental contingencies associated with the events or by a stable expectancy of the perceiver. In a community study, 118 respondents were asked to report stressful life events experienced in the last year and were then asked to what extent they anticipated and controlled the occurrence of each event. Data were collected in 2 waves 1 yr apart. Analysis of the reliability, within each wave, of perceptions of control did not indicate a strong personal expectancy effect. It did show some evidence of environmental determination of perceptions, but this result was not consistent for the 2 waves. Results are interpreted in relation to ways of reducing harmful effects of stressful life events.

"1363","Group cohesion, task performance, and the experimenter expectancy effect","Studied the effects of cohesion on task fulfillment and explored the influence of task fulfillment on the initial level of cohesion. Within 4-person groups of undergraduates, cohesion was manipulated successfully by a triple procedure. The level of cohesion was ascertained directly after the induction treatment and again after task fulfillment. Group and individual ability tasks were used in Exp I (144 Ss) and Exp II (91 Ss), while individual learning tasks were used in Exp III (126 Ss). The hypothesis that cohesion facilitates task performance was partly supported for both individual and group tasks. All 8 comparisons of the means favored the high-cohesion condition; only 4 of the differences, however, were significant. Performing a group task tended to raise cohesion, whereas individual performance lowered liking for the group. There were no indications that the findings were a function of a pretest effect of the cohesion questionnaire or the experimenter's awareness of the research hypotheses. The facilitating influence of cohesion on task fulfillment is considered a consequence of heightened drive level of group members.

"1366","Interpersonal expectancy effects: The first 345 studies","The research area of interpersonal expectancy effects originally derived from consideration of the effects of experimenters on the results of their research. One of these is the expectancy effect, the tendency for experimenters (Es) to obtain results they expect, not simply because they have correctly anticipated nature's response but rather because they helped to shape that response through their expectations. In recent years, the research has been extended from Es to teachers, employers, and therapists whose expectations for their pupils, employees, and patients might also come to serve as interpersonal self-fulfilling prophecies. The results of 345 experiments investigating interpersonal expectancy effects are summarized. These studies fall into 8 broad categories of research: reaction time, inkblot tests, animal learning, laboratory interviews, psychophysical judgments, learning and ability, person perception, and everyday life situations. For the entire sample of studies, as well as for each specific research area (a) the overall probability that interpersonal expectancy effects do in fact occur is determined, (b) their average magnitude is estimated to evaluate their substantive and methodological importance, and (c) methods that may be useful to others wishing to summarize quantitatively entire bodies of research are illustrated. 30 peer comments and a reply by the authors are included.

"1367","A sense of story","Discusses the sense of story in terms of spectator and participant roles, expectations about characters in stories, the real and the make-believe, and learning to read. In the participant role one judges primarily criteria of objective truth. In the spectator role one looks for internal consistency, a sense of fitness and proportion with the parts integrated into a coherent whole. The stages in development of narrative structure show a collection of instances (episodes) to be linked together on the basis of shared or complementary attributes. Changing expectations about what a story is and expanding interests in life experiences are reflected in changes in stories told by young children. Nine-year-olds have more concrete expectations than 6-yr-olds about how characters behave. The distinction between real and make-believe develops quite late. A child's sense of story includes syntactic and semantic expectations, best conceptualized in the notion of text forming components of meaning. The general pattern in retelling unfamiliar stories among children and adults is one of rationalization and elaboration. Beginning-reading instructional materials are usually narratives, and attempts to replace this material with factual reading have never been successful.

Search time was controlled by the surreptitious insertion of lags between the onset of the background (i.e., start of search) and the actual appearance of the target. Post-target search time (total search time minus lag) was employed as the dependent variable. Three lags (0, 7.5, and 15 sec) were used in a random order. Results show 2 effects: (a) Post-target search time was reduced if the previous trial had used the same lag as the given trial. (b) Post-target search time increased with lag. Both effects are explained by the construction of a sequential expectancy model.

"1373","Effects of tutor's locus of control and expectancy information on tutor behaviour and pupil performance","Investigated the effects of tutor's locus of control and induced expectancy on tutor behavior and pupil performance on a word recognition task. The experimental situation involved 2 successive stages of teaching separated by a period of verbal interaction between the tutor and the pupil. 72 female tutors, 36 internals and 36 externals, were randomly assigned to 2 expectancy conditions, positive and negative. Expectancy information was given in the form of a simulated psychological report. 72 kindergarten children were randomly assigned to the 4 groups. Three female observers recorded the tutor's behavior and pupil's performance on a standardized observation schedule. Results fail to show either a main expectancy effect or an interaction between expectancy and locus of control on the key measures of words presented by tutor and number of words recognized by pupils. However, an effect was found in that tutors with negative expectations taught more words in the 2nd part of the session, perhaps because they were pleasantly surprised by the students' progress, whereas tutors with positive expectations were disappointed. The faiure to replicate previous findings is attributed to methodological differences among the studies and to the limits of generality of expectancy phenomena.

Free study led to better recall and recognition than paced presentation, but did not interact with test expectancy. Exp II demonstrated that recall was better for 54 Ss expecting a recall vs a recognition test in the absence of preliminary practice. In Exp III all 160 Ss practiced both recall and recognition prior to presentation of the critical list. Study time also was varied. With longer study, recall was better when a recall test was expected, with no test expectancy effect on recognition. There were no appreciable expectancy effects with the short study period.

E's and S's perceived locus of control scores (Rotter's Internal-External Control Scale) were incorporated into the design to test their relevance as a mediating variables. Immediately after the presentation of the tendon tap stimulus, S's EEG alpha measures were more biased in the direction of the E's expectations when Es and Ss were similar in their scores on the locus of control scale. Biasing effects on EEG alpha measures in the direction of E's expectations were found early in the experimental session where Ss or their E's scored as internally controlled. The EMG measures increased or decreased in the direction of the E's expectations when Ss were internally controlled, but there was a reversal of the direction of the E's expectations with Ss who scored as externally controlled so that no significant E expectancy effect was observed.

In each room the Ss ranked 1-16 were equally divided into an experimental and a control group. Each teacher was told the names of the Ss in the experimental group in her classroom, and that these Ss would show large gains in language and arithmetic. The disguised SATs were given again at the middle and end of the school year. Multiple regression analyses of the SATs showed that manipulation of teacher bias produced no significant effects, but that teacher ranking showed strong, consistent effects.

The 2 sources of social influence were established prior to induction of hypnosis. The sources were studied for their effects within the framework of a factorial design in which model and hypnotist expectancies about appropriate hypnotic response were manipulated simultaneously, in harmony and in opposition to each other.

"1388","Premarital communication skills education with university students","Presents a report on a 5 session communications skills group program using videotape to provide models and feedback to participants. The participants included 6 dating couples. Purpose of the program was to increase communications skills of participants through practice and observation of behavior in themselves and others. Measurements used were Affective Sensitivity Scale, a Self Disclosure Questionnaire, an Interpersonal Communication Inventory, and a Communications Knowledge Test. Significant change was found on the Jouard's Self Disclosure and the Communications Knowledge Test with no statistically significant change in the other 2 measures. Participants felt they improved their communication with partners and benefited from videotape equipment for feedback, models, and discussion stimulus. Recommendations for future programs include use of live models to decrease inhibitions for subsequent participant role playing, and reading lists and homework to allow more time for in-class activities.

In spite of significant variation of Es within each condition (p &lt; .001), the prior sets did affect the expectancy effects shown (p &lt; .06). Es given an outcome-oriented set differed significantly from Es given a procedure-oriented set (p &lt; .04) and from control Es (p &lt; .05) in the extent to which they biased Ss in the direction of their expectations, while the procedure and control groups did not differ from one another. Overall, outcome Es showed significant biasing (p &lt; .05) while the procedure and control groups did not, but one E in each of the latter groups showed significant reverse biasing.

In all conditions the standard tone matched the center tone of the comparison set in length. In Exp. I, 6 groups of 7 Ss and 7 Es each were employed. Though covertly introducing expectancies to either S, E, or both, as to where in the progression the standard matched, both S and E expectancy effects were induced, and found to interact additively to sway the data in the direction of expectancy when compared to naive controls. It was found that Ss in groups that did not confirm the E's expectancy were judged by the Es as not to have been cooperative in following direction. Exp. II, 3 groups of 5 Ss and 5 Es each were used. In all groups S was naive and E was given a downward expectancy. It was found that the E expectancy effect could be transmitted by either verbal or facial cues alone.

"1411","Can hypnosis make you ticklish? Using suggestion to modulate agency","Sense of agency is the subjective sense of control we have over our actions. According to comparator model accounts, this arises when the predicted sensory effects of movements match actual sensory feedback. A consequence of this matching is sensory attenuation of self-generated actions. This explains why, typically, we cannot tickle ourselves. Mechanically manipulating the sensory consequences of actions, however, can create a mismatch and the illusion that they are externally produced; that is, self-tickling becomes ticklish. Across three experiments, we aimed to create similar alterations in agency using hypnosis. We compared different suggestions—based on real-world examples of agency disruptions—for participants of different levels of hypnotizability, with and without a hypnotic induction. We found that suggestions designed to model self-monitoring deficits increased perceived ticklishness. These effects were stronger in high-hypnotizable participants and after an induction. Demand characteristics may explain behavioral but not subjective responses to tickling.

Recent work suggests that it is negatively correlated with the ability to discriminate visually similar dishes, but only in color. This led to a novel prediction: that colorblindness would be negatively associated with food neophobia. Here, we replicated that colorblind men (n = 103) are less food neophobic than non-colorblind men (n = 273), even when participants are unaware that being colorblind or not was relevant to their selection. We extend these results to food disgust, and find that both food neophobia and food disgust increase with age in colorblind men, whereas they are stable in noncolorblind men. These results underscore the role of color perception on affective attitudes towards food, in the absence of demand characteristics or manipulation of color in images. Our results advance our understanding of non-perceptual and affective consequences of colorblindness. They also have possible implications for improving treatment approaches in cases of severe food neophobia.

"1414","Testing the effects of facial sexual dimorphism on selective attention, memory, and decision making","Studies have shown that facial sexual dimorphism, ranging on a continuum from very feminine to very masculine, affects observers' ratings of dominance and threat. These studies, however, have used forced-choice paradigms, in which a pair of faces that have been manipulated to appear more masculine (masculinized) and feminine (feminized) are presented side by side. They are susceptible to demand characteristics, situational aspects of the experiment which produce the desired outcome, because participants may be able to draw the conclusion that faces which appear more masculine should be rated as more dominant. In this dissertation, I evaluated whether facial sexual dimorphism affects observers' threat perceptions in a way that minimizes the confounds caused by demand characteristics. In Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, I presented observers with masculinized and feminized faces individually, rather than in pairs, and for an extremely brief duration (Experiment 1). I predicted that observers would assign higher dominance (Experiment 1) and threat ratings (Experiment 2) to masculinized faces. Observers assigned higher dominance (Experiment 1) and threat (Experiment 2) ratings to masculinized faces, even when they were presented individually, and for as little as 100 milliseconds (ms) (Experiment 1). This would suggest that they can appraise differences in facial sexual dimorphism following very brief exposure. I proceeded to evaluate the effects of facial sexual dimorphism on men's selective attention, while reducing the effects of demand characteristics, by testing for an attentional bias towards task-irrelevant masculinized men's faces. In Experiment 3, forty-five men completed a Posner Cueing Paradigm in which they classified shapes, presented either right or left of center screen after a masculinized or feminized man's face was presented in either the same or opposite location. Participants were faster to classify the shape following the presentation of a masculine face; however, they were not faster when a masculine face cued target position. In Experiment 4, forty-four men completed a Flanker Task in which they judged letter orientation (i.e., upright or upside-down), while ignoring flanking faces. Participants' RT was not affected by Morph Type (i.e., whether the face was masculinized, feminized or unmodified). In Experiment 5, forty-one men completed a Dot Probe Task. They were presented with two facial photographs of different Morph Types to the left and right of center screen. This was followed by the presentation of a target shape, in the location of one of the faces. Participants' objective was to classify shape orientation. Facial sexual dimorphism did not affect participants' classification speed. In Experiment 6, I primed participants with images meant to induce fear or arousal before each trial of a Dot Probe Task. Following the presentation of a fear inducing picture, participants RT to classify shapes when a masculinized face cued target position did not differ from when a feminized face cued target position. The two different presentation times did not create different patterns of results, indicating that masculinized faces did not induce either a cueing or inhibitory affect. Overall, my results do not support my hypothesis that men selectively attend to masculinized faces when they are presented as irrelevant information.

"1415","A randomized trial of two group-delivered transdiagnostic eating disorder treatments: Dissonance-based treatment versus interpersonal psychotherapy","Objective: Test whether a group-delivered dissonance-based transdiagnostic eating disorder treatment, Body Project Treatment (BPT), produces greater reductions in eating disorder symptoms and higher abstinence from eating disorder behaviors and remittance from eating disorder diagnoses than group-delivered transdiagnostic interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Method: Women with a range of eating disorders (N = 73) were randomized to 8-week group-implemented BPT or IPT and completed surveys and masked diagnostic interviews at pretest, posttest, and 6-month follow-up. Results: Participants randomized to BPT versus IPT showed significantly greater reductions in eating disorder symptoms (d = -.75), pursuit of the thin ideal (d = -.87), anxiety symptoms (d = -.76), and social impairment (d = -.59) through 6-month follow-up. By end of treatment, participants randomized to the BPT versus IPT did not significantly differ on abstinence from binge eating and purging (49% vs. 40%, respectively) or remittance from eating disorder diagnoses (54% vs. 40%, respectively). Participants randomized to BPT versus IPT did not differ significantly in average session attendance (5.8 vs. 6.9, respectively) or average homework assignments completed (4.6 vs. 5.6, respectively). The within-condition reductions in eating disorder symptoms for BPT did not significantly differ when implemented in person versus via synchronous video telepsychiatry (d = -1.39 vs. -1.09, respectively), though these effects should be considered preliminary because of the small cell sizes. Conclusions: The evidence that BPT produces greater reductions in eating disorder symptoms, pursuit of the thin ideal, anxiety symptoms, and social impairment than IPT is encouraging because it provides some assurance that the effects are present equating for the effects of expectancies, demand characteristics, and nonspecific factors.

"1416","Reassessing referral of touch following peripheral deafferentation: The role of contextual bias","Some amputees have been famously reported to perceive facial touch as arising from their phantom hand. These referred sensations have since been replicated across multiple neurological disorders and were classically interpreted as a perceptual correlate of cortical plasticity. Common to all these and related studies is that participants might have been influenced in their self-reports by the experimental design or related contextual biases. Here, we investigated whether referred sensations reports might be confounded by demand characteristics (e.g., compliance, expectation, suggestion). Unilateral upper-limb amputees (N = 18), congenital one-handers (N = 19), and two-handers (N = 22) were repeatedly stimulated with computer-controlled vibrations on 10 body-parts and asked to report the occurrence of any concurrent sensations on their hand(s). To further manipulate expectations, we gave participants the suggestion that some of these vibrations had a higher probability to evoke referred sensations. We also assessed similarity between (phantom) hand and face representation in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) multivariate representational similarity analysis. We replicated robust reports of referred sensations in amputees towards their phantom hand; however, the frequency and distribution of reported referred sensations were similar across groups. Moreover, referred sensations were evoked by stimulation of multiple body-parts and similarly reported on both the intact and phantom hand in amputees. Face-to-phantom-hand representational similarity was not different in amputees' missing hand region, compared with controls. These findings weaken the interpretation of referred sensations as a perceptual correlate of S1 plasticity and reveal the need to account for contextual biases when evaluating anomalous perceptual phenomena.

"1417","The effect of different types of TikTok dance challenge videos on young women's body satisfaction","The aim of this paper was to investigate the effect of different types of TikTok dance challenge videos on young women's body satisfaction. Study 1 involved 262 women aged between 18 and 25 years, who were randomly assigned to watch TikTok videos featuring either thin dancers, large dancers, or amusing animal videos. Body satisfaction significantly increased after watching large dancer TikTok videos and decreased after watching thin dancer TikTok videos, although this decrease was not significant. Study 2 replicated and extended study 1 and involved 280 women aged between 18 and 25 years. Females body satisfaction significantly decreased after watching the thin dancer TikTok videos and significantly increased after watching the large dancer TikTok videos. There was no significant difference between the participants in terms of state appearance comparison. Females in the thin dancer condition engaged in upward social comparison, whereas the females in the large dancer condition engaged in downward social compression. The impact of video type was not moderated either by trait appearance comparison, or thin ideal internalization. The effect of video type was not mediated by state appearance comparison but was fully mediated by the direction of social comparison. Study 3 involved 375 women aged between 18 and 25 years and found that body satisfaction was lower after watching the thin dancers than after watching the large dancers. This study shows that findings from the previous two studies could not be explained by the demand characteristics in the design of these studies. All three studies show that exposure to large dancers on TikTok has a positive impact on women's body satisfaction, whereas exposure to thin dancers has a negative impact on women's body satisfaction. The implications of these findings for the design of social media are discussed.

"1418","Performing well but not appreciating it – a trait feature of anorexia nervosa","Background Despite advances in the etiology of anorexia nervosa (AN), a large subgroup of individuals does not profit optimally from treatment. Perfectionism has been found to be a risk factor predicting the onset, severity, and duration of AN episodes. To date, perfectionism has been studied predominantly by the use of self-report questionnaires, a useful approach that may, however, be impacted by demand characteristics, or other distortions of introspective or metacognitive access. Methods Here we circumvent these problems via a behavioral paradigm in which participants perform a modified Go/NoGo task, whilst self-evaluating their performance. We compared a group of 33 adolescent females during their first episode of AN (age = 16.0) with 29 female controls (age = 16.2), and 23 adolescent girls recovered from AN (age = 18.3) with 23 female controls (age = 18.5). The controls were closely matched by intelligence quotient and age to the two clinical groups. Results First-episode AN and control participants performed equally well on the task (reaction time and errors of commission), whereas the recovered group displayed significantly faster reaction times but incurred the same error rate. Despite performing at least as good as and predominantly better than control groups, both clinical groups evaluated their performances more negatively than controls. Conclusion We offer a novel behavioral method for measuring perfectionism independent of self-report, and we provide tentative evidence that this behavioral manifestation of perfectionism is evident during first-episode AN and persists even after recovery.

"1419","Are there dominant response tendencies for social reactions? Trust trumps mistrust—evidence from a Dominant Behavior Measure (DBM)","The question of whether individuals are more prone to trust or to mistrust has increasingly interested economists and psychologists in recent years. To investigate whether people have an initial response tendency to trust versus mistrust, we developed a novel paradigm—the Dominant Behavior Measure (DBM). Capitalizing on decades of meticulous research in basic cognitive psychology (i.e., bilingual studies, Stroop paradigm), we designed a task to measure the dominance of reactions in the social realm. Participants engaged in a series of trust games that involved switching between trusting and mistrusting two trustworthy counterparts and two untrustworthy counterparts, identified by color (while ignoring a distractor name) or by name (when no color was presented). Like other dominant response tendencies (e.g., participant’s first language), trust is faster, harder to switch to, and more interfering/facilitating than mistrust (Experiments 1–7). The dominance of trust holds in various social contexts—certainty of counterpart’s un/trustworthiness (Experiments 4a-4c), unfamiliar counterparts (Experiments 5 and 6), counterparts from one’s in-group versus out-group (Experiment 6), and negative framing of trust (Experiment 7)—showing that the dominant tendency to trust people (but not nonsocial objects, Experiment 8) is context-independent and robust. We rule out alternative explanations such as asymmetric payoff (Experiments 2 and 4b), familiarity and strength of association (Experiments 5 and 6), demand characteristics (Experiment 7), and positivity bias (Experiment 8). Introducing the DBM as a novel paradigm, we show that trust dominates mistrust and discuss the potential of this paradigm to determine dominant responses in manifold social domains.

"1420","Psychological burden of achalasia: Patients’ screening rates of depression and anxiety and sex differences","This study examined whether self-reports or ratings of experienced affect, often used as manipulation checks on the efficacy of affect induction procedures (AIPs), reflect genuine changes in affective states rather than response biases arising from demand characteristics or social desirability effects. In a between-participants design, participants were exposed to positive, negative and neutral images with valence-congruent music or sound to induce happy, sad and neutral mood. Half of the participants had to actively appraise each image whereas the other half viewed images passively. We hypothesised that if ratings of affective valence are subject to response biases then they should reflect the target mood in the same way for active appraisal and passive exposure as participants encountered the same affective stimuli in both conditions. We also tested whether the AIP resulted in mood-congruent changes in facial expressions analysed by FaceReader to see whether behavioural indicators corroborate the self-reports. The results showed that while participants’ ratings reflected the induced target valence, the difference between positive and negative AIP was significantly attenuated in the active appraisal condition, suggesting that self-reports of mood experienced after the AIP are not entirely a reflection of response biases. However, there were no effects of the AIP on FaceReader valence scores, in line with theories questioning the existence of cross-culturally and inter-individually universal behavioural indicators of affective states. Efficacy of AIPs is therefore best checked using self-reports.

"1421","Unblinding and demand characteristics in the treatment of depression","Blinding of treatment allocation in clinical trials in psychiatry is regarded as an ideal. The potential impact of unblinding chimes with a general concern for psychological research: so-called demand characteristics can undermine confidence in findings from experimental and clinical studies. Scepticism can result in nihilism. The reliance on subjective report of symptoms in clinical trials of drug efficacy in depression provides an important example. It is regularly implied that if subjective effects, including specific adverse reactions, unblind participants to an active treatment then evidence for its efficacy is suspect. In fact, the strong association between dose and subjective effects does not translate into a strong relationship with efficacy in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of conventional antidepressant drugs; this observation falsifies the proposition that unblinding is the principal mechanism driving RCT outcomes in studies of depression. Instead, changes in brain function, that occur soon after treatment starts, do predict treatment outcomes and align with our understanding of neurotransmitter effects from neuroscience. Psychedelic experience for the treatment of depression must be unblinding, but the effect results directly from serotonergic receptor activation and changes in brain connectivity. Where such effects are part of a novel mechanism of action, a strong dose response relationship would be expected, irrespective of unblinding. We highlight the importance of exploring blinding as a mechanism, confirming dose-related outcomes, and dissociating unblinding effects from efficacy. Unblinding does not necessarily invalidate the subjective experience of sustained recovery from depression.

"1422","Does men’s facial sexual dimorphism affect male observers’ selective attention?","Facial sexual dimorphism affects observers’ physical dominance ratings. Here, we test whether such perceived dominance influences selective attention. To minimize demand characteristics, we examined whether task-irrelevant masculinized men’s faces would show an attentional bias in several experimental paradigms. Experiment 1 employed a Posner Cueing Paradigm in which participants classified shapes after a masculinized or feminized man’s face was presented. We could not find a difference in participants’ classification speeds when either feminized or masculinized face cued target position. Experiment 2 employed a Flanker Task in which participants judged letter orientation, while ignoring flanking faces. There was no observed difference in participants’ reaction time (RT) when masculinized faces flanked the target. Experiment 3 employed a Dot Probe Task, where participants were presented with a masculinized face and a feminized face to the left and right of center screen, and a target shape was presented in the location of one face. Participants’ task was to classify shape orientation. We observe a small effect of facial sexual dimorphism on participants’ classification speed. In Experiment 4, we primed participants with images meant to induce fear or arousal before each trial of a Dot Probe Task. Following the presentation of a fear inducing picture, participants RT to classify shapes when a masculinized face cued target position did not differ from when a feminized face cued target position. The two different presentation times did not create different patterns of results, indicating that masculinized faces did not induce either a cueing or inhibitory affect. Overall, we failed to support the hypothesis that people selectively attend to masculinized faces when they are presented as irrelevant information.

"1423","Longer duration intertrial intervals without visual stimuli have reinforcement value and increase the rate of reinforcement and punishment learning in computer-based discriminations in humans","In two experiments, we examined the motivational value of the duration of intertrial intervals and/or task delays on responding in a computer-based task in humans. In both experiments, four color stimuli with different response contingencies were displayed. Participants freely decided if they want to make a response or not towards each stimulus. The outcome that followed was either a putatively pleasant visual feedback (a “smiley face” display) or a blank screen, which was contingent on whether a response was made or withheld differently for different color stimuli. Our key manipulation was whether this blank screen outcome was longer or shorter than the visual feedback, that is whether the blank screen outcome made the next trial start sooner, later, or with the same delay as earning the visual feedback. We found 1) increased reinforced responding for encouraging visual feedback and 2) faster reinforcement and punishment learning to respond or withhold responding for this visual feedback if there was a longer duration blank screen outcome on trials in which people did not earn the visual feedback. This effect appeared to be driven more by the absolute length of the blank screen stimulus rather than whether it increased the delay until the start of the next trial more than the visual feedback. Additional research is needed to investigate boundary conditions that may determine when these blank screens do/do not have this motivational effect. Our findings suggest that manipulating task delay may be a way to increase motivation in laboratory studies in humans and possibly minimize individual differences in motivation due to differing sensitivity to demand characteristics in individual participants. However, additional research is needed to eliminate alternative explanations for this effect, such as an effect in which longer blank screen presentations led to better learning by preventing poorer learning that can be observed after massed trial presentations.

"1424","Modeling verbal short-term memory: A walk around the neighborhood","When remembering over the short-term, long-term knowledge has a large effect on the number of correctly recalled items and little impact on memory for order. This is true, for example, when the effects of semantic category are examined. Contrary to what these findings suggest, Poirier et al. in 2015 proposed that memory for order relies on the level of activation within long-term networks. Importantly, although their view has been criticized, they showed that manipulating semantic associations led to item migrations that were atypical. In this article, we show that similar migrations can be obtained with another knowledge-based factor: orthographic neighborhood. In three experiments, we manipulated the orthographic neighborhood of to-be-recalled items. The latter is a sublexical factor; as such, it is much less likely than semantic relatedness to involve demand characteristics or grouping strategies. The first experiment established that the neighborhood manipulation produced the pattern of item migrations previously observed with semantic relatedness, confirming that the migration effect can generalize to other variables. The last two experiments suggested that migrations were due to the features shared across list items rather than to item co-activation (as in Poirier et al.). The results were successfully modeled by calling upon the Revised Feature Model, where recall depends on selecting a retrieval candidate based on the features of the cueing information. Overall, our findings underline the usefulness of a model where retrieval is determined by relative distinctiveness and underline that multiple mechanisms can lead to order errors in recall.

"1425","Fact or artifact? Demand characteristics and participants’ beliefs can moderate, but do not fully account for, the effects of facial feedback on emotional experience","The facial feedback hypothesis suggests that an individual’s facial expressions can influence their emotional experience (e.g., that smiling can make one feel happier). However, a reoccurring concern is that supposed facial feedback effects are merely methodological artifacts. Six experiments conducted across 29 countries ( N = 995) examined the extent to which the effects of posed facial expressions on emotion reports were moderated by (a) the hypothesis communicated to participants (i.e., demand characteristics) and (b) participants’ beliefs about facial feedback effects. Results indicated that these methodological artifacts moderated, but did not fully account for, the effects of posed facial expressions on emotion reports. Even when participants were explicitly told or personally believed that facial poses do not influence emotions, they still exhibited facial feedback effects. These results indicate that facial feedback effects are not solely driven by demand or placebo effects.

"1426","The link between individual predictors of risk and risky flight behavior: A systematic review","Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to highlight how pilots’ risk perception is measured, and the relationship between individual predictors of risk and risky flight behavior. Background: Risk is an intrinsic part of life with no action void of risk. Risk-taking is mediated by several factors which include age, sex, cultural background, and personality. Understanding how pilots’ risk perception is measured allows for improved understanding of pilots’ propensity to engage in risk, and for the design of training initiatives to mitigate risky behavior. Method: A systematic review was conducted to establish the link between individual predictors of risk, and risky flight behavior. The systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines, covering the time span between 1985 and 2021. Sixteen articles meeting the inclusion criteria were revealed. Results: Three of the 16 articles employed an in-situ behavioral measure for risky flight behavior. Forecasting, where an individual predicts his/her action in a particular circumstance was the most used measure to deduce pilots’ risk-taking behavior. No predictor variable reliably predicted pilots’ risky flight behavior. Conclusion: This systematic review highlights the majority of research examining the relationship between individual predictors of risk, and risky flight behavior relies on self-reported measures or scales as opposed to in-situ performance measures such as data captured during flight or in a simulator. Such performance measures are susceptible to demand characteristics.

"1427","Efficacy of applied relaxation as indicated preventive intervention in individuals at increased risk for mental disorders: A randomized controlled trial","The objective was to examine the efficacy of Applied Relaxation (AR) as indicated preventive intervention to reduce psychopathological symptoms and prevent incident mental disorders. In a parallel-group randomized controlled trial, N = 277 adults with elevated tension/distress, anxiety, or depressive symptomatology (Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale, DASS-21) but no 12-month DSM-5 diagnosis of any mental disorder assessed via standardized interview (DIA-X-5) were randomized to an intervention group (IG; n = 139) receiving group-based AR training, or an assessment-only control group (CG, n = 138). Self-report questionnaires at baseline, post (immediately after the 10 week intervention or a similar time frame in CG) and 12-month follow-up included the DASS-21 as primary outcome measure of intervention efficacy. Incident subthreshold and threshold mental disorders were assessed via DIA-X-5 at 12-month follow-up as primary outcome of prevention efficacy. Intervention and prevention effects were examined on an intent-to-treat basis with missing data replaced using chained multiple imputation. Mixed-model analyses revealed accelerated symptom improvement in IG versus CG with a medium baseline-to-post between-group effect size (d = 0.59, 95%CI: 0.36–0.82). Logistic regression analysis revealed a significantly lower incidence rate for (sub-)threshold mental disorders until 12-month follow-up in IG (34.7%) versus CG (49.3%; Odds Ratio: 0.54, 95%CI: 0.31–0.92, Risk Ratio: 0.70, 95%CI: 0.51–0.96, Risk Difference = -0.15, 95%CI: -0.28 to -0.02). Group-based AR as a promising indicative preventive intervention should be tested in long-term studies and relative to a credible alternative intervention to assure that the intervention effects are not entirely due to demand characteristics, expectancies, or non-specific effects.

To reduce demand characteristics that reinforce gender binaries in children’s models of gender, we relied on open-ended discourse analysis to study children’s physical gender schemas. We focused on whether children’s ability to ask questions that distinguish gender groups was greater in older than younger children. Participants were 44 3–4-year-olds, 35 5–6-year-olds, and 23 7–8-year-old children in the U.K. who were led through a guessing game to elicit gender-related beliefs and compare their beliefs about gender to their beliefs about other entities such as living things. When asking questions to distinguish gender binary groups, older children judging gendered individuals were more likely to ask questions that stereotypically distinguished the gender groups than younger children. Older children were also more likely to focus on individuals’ biological properties, clothing, and hair length than were younger children. Thus, the development of a child’s understanding of physical gender schemas gender is discrete, developing gradually at least until the age of 8.

The IIPSS provides a relatively context-free measure of people's tendencies to solve problems independently or with the help of others.

Investigations of four student samples (combined N = 1157) and one sample comprised of academic researchers (N = 198) generally supported the reliability and validity of the IIPSS. Exploratory factor analysis of IIPSS items yielded a single factor structure. However, confirmatory factor analyses did not demonstrate good model fit for the one factor solution and instead yielded good model fit for two underlying factors. The IIPSS showed adequate test–retest reliability and predicted positive associations with social personality traits. It also showed no significant associations with measures of demand characteristics and social desirability. Future research needs to be undertaken to further assess the factor structure and address shortcomings of the present research such as utilising objective data in addition to self-reports to assess the scale's validity.

"1430","Medical education videos as a tool for rehearsal: Efficiency and the cases of background music and difficulty","This study reports a field experiment investigating how instructional videos with and without background music contribute to the learning of examination techniques within a formal curriculum of medical teaching. Following a classroom teaching unit on the techniques for examining the knee and the shoulder joint, our participants (N = 175) rehearsed the studied techniques for either the knee or the shoulder joint with an instructional video with or without background music. As dependent measures, we collected a general questionnaire, a prediction of test performance, as well as performance on an exam-like knowledge test covering both joints. For both videos, the participants who had watched the particular video during rehearsal were more accurate in answering the corresponding questions than the participants who had seen the other video, signaling that instructional videos provide a useful tool for rehearsal (i.e., both groups reciprocally served as control groups). For the knee video (less difficult), we observed a detrimental effect of the background music, whereas we observed no such effect for the shoulder video (more difficult). Further explorations revealed that background music might be detrimental for learning, as it reduces the perceived demand characteristics. Because the impact of the demand characteristics might be more pronounced in less difficult instructional videos, we discuss video difficulty as a potential moderating factor. Overall, our study provides evidence that instructional videos could be usefully implemented in formal teaching curricula and that such instructional videos probably should be designed without background music.

"1431","Customer-Country diversification and inventory efficiency: Comparative evidence from the manufacturing sector during the pre-pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic periods","This study empirically examines the impact of geographic customer diversification on inventory efficiency and proposes a customer-country diversification strategy as a central element of U.S. manufacturing firms’ effort to transform their global supply chains in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using industry-level data during the pre-pandemic period (2003–2018) and the COVID-19 pandemic, this study finds that a geographically diversified customer base significantly reduced inventory efficiency during the pre-pandemic period, but increased inventory efficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our finding suggests that U.S. manufacturing firms may be able to reduce negative impacts on inventory in a global pandemic and achieve greater inventory efficiency if they can target global customer bases with demand characteristics less correlated with U.S. domestic demand.

"1432","Interpreting treatment effect size from single case experimental design data: A preliminary analysis of differential effects of treatments designed to increase or decrease behaviour","Background Estimates of treatment effect size from single case experimental design (SCED) data may be impacted by the direction for treatment effects (i.e. ascending or descending slope for the dependent variable). Estimating effect sizes for treatments designed to decrease behaviour are potentially more restricted because the intended direction for treatment is zero (i.e. an absolute basal). Conversely, effect sizes for interventions that increase behaviour are less restricted due to a relatively unconstrained ceiling from a pure measurement standpoint (i.e. no absolute ceiling). That is, treatments that increase behaviour have a broader range of possible effect size values as the ceiling is only limited by demand characteristics and the learners' skills and motivation to exhibit the behaviour. Method The current study represents a preliminary analysis of the mean and range of SCED effect sizes for treatments designed to either increase or decrease target behaviour. A within-case Cohen's d measure that was developed for SCED data was used to estimate treatment effect sizes. Results Results indicated that the mean and range of effect size values for treatments that increased behaviour were significantly greater compared with treatments that decreased behaviour. Conclusions Results are discussed in terms of developing standards, or best practices, specific to interpreting effect size values and meeting quality control requirements for inclusion of the data set in future SCED meta-analytic studies estimating treatment effect size. Specifically, preliminary results suggest that benchmarks for low, medium and high SCED effect size values need to be developed separately for treatments that increase or decrease levels of the dependent variable.

"1433","Multisensory integration dominates hypnotisability and expectations in the rubber hand illusion","Some recent papers by P. Lush and colleagues have argued that the rubber hand illusion (RHI), where participants can feel a rubber hand as their own under appropriate multisensory stimulation, may be caused mainly by hypnotic suggestibility and expectations (demand characteristics). These papers rely primarily on a study with 353 participants who took part in a RHI experiment carried out in a classical way with brush stroking. Participants experienced a synchronous condition where the rubber hand was seen to be touched in synchrony with touch felt on their corresponding hidden real hand, or the touches were applied asynchronously as a control. Each participant had a related measure of their hypnotisability on a scale known as the Sussex-Waterloo Scale of Hypnotisability (SWASH). The authors found a correlation between the questionnaire ratings of the RHI in the synchronous condition and the SWASH score. From this, they concluded that the RHI is largely driven by suggestibility and further proposed that suggestibility and expectations may even entirely explain the RHI. Here we examine their claims in a series of extensive new analyses of their data. We find that at every level of SWASH, the synchronous stimulation results in greater levels of the illusion than the asynchronous condition; moreover, proprioceptive drift is greater in the synchronous case at every level of SWASH. Thus, while the level of hypnotisability does modestly influence the subjective reports (higher SWASH is associated with somewhat higher illusion ratings), the major difference between the synchronous and asynchronous stimulation is always present. Furthermore, by including in the model the participants’ expectancy ratings of how strongly they initially believed they would experience the RHI in the two conditions, we show that expectations had a very small effect on the illusion ratings; model comparisons further demonstrate that the multisensory condition is two-to-three-times as dominant as the other factors, with hypnotisability contributing modestly and expectations negligibly. Thus, although the results indicate that trait suggestibility may modulate the RHI, presumably through intersubject variations in top-down factors, the findings also suggest that the primary explanation for the RHI is as a multisensory bodily illusion.

"1434","Ethical challenges in qualitative methods to improve pediatric clinical care: Researcher perspectives","Objective: The purpose of the current project was to distill guidance for psychology researchers regarding ethical challenges that may arise in the conduct of qualitative research aimed to improve pediatric clinical care. Method: 6 pediatric psychologists with relevant research experience participated in semistructured interviews. Data were analyzed using inductive methods of general thematic analysis and then emerging ethical issues were interpreted within the framework of the American Psychological Association (APA) Ethics Code. Results: 6 broad areas of ethical considerations were derived: Establish competence and ensure research rigor; clearly distinguish research and clinical roles; consider the potential for sample selection bias and demand characteristics; protect research participants, especially minors; attend to common and unique privacy and confidentiality concerns; and respect provider stakeholders and the clinical setting. Researchers consistently identified proactive, rather than reactive approaches, in addressing potential ethical concerns. Some of the themes and subthemes represent typical considerations of psychology research while others speak to the unique elements of qualitative methodologies, pediatric populations, and clinical care improvement. Conclusions: Researchers’ identified ethical considerations aligned with the APA Ethics Code, specifically sections 2 (competence), 3 (human relations), 4 (privacy and confidentiality), and 8 (research and publication). Recommendations were derived to aid in study planning and reflect the importance of considering competencies within the research team, dual relationships, privacy and confidentiality, and the context of clinical qualitative research. Overwhelmingly, researchers encouraged others to conduct qualitative pediatric clinical care research and emphasized the invaluable nature of the rich, in-depth information gained from such research.

"1435","Risky-choice framing and its null effect on integral emotions","The effects of risky-choice framing are well-established and have been demonstrated in several decision contexts. Recent research has pointed to a role for affect and emotions in risky-choice framing, but those findings may have been influenced by carry-over effects due to the use of multiple decision problems. In a one-off decision, the effects of risky-choice framing on affect and emotions remain unclear. This article extends the risky-choice framing literature by using the Emotion-Imbued Choice model to investigate whether integral fear and anger can account for the effects of risky-choice framing in a one-off decision. In two studies involving a one-off decision about internet connectivity and human lives respectively, we expected higher levels of integral fear in participants who chose the certain option in the positive framing condition as compared to the negative framing condition, and also higher levels of integral anger in participants who chose the risky option in the negative framing condition as compared to the positive framing condition. Our findings did not support these hypotheses and suggest that the effects of risky-choice framing are not due to integral emotions. We explained our findings by proposing that the choice architecture involved in risky-choice framing prevents integral emotions from becoming attached to the choice options because it offers a less effortful decision tactic than considering one’s emotional response to those options. We call for future research to investigate this possibility and to also consider the demand characteristics of conducting risky-choice framing problems online.

"1436","Commentary on Graham et al.: Biochemical verification of abstinence in remotely conducted smoking cessation trials should not be a universal design requirement for rigor","Comments on an article by A. L. Graham et al. (see record 2021-90462-001). The study by Graham et al. is an innovative and much needed evaluation of text messaging as an augmentation to web-based smoking intervention. Contrary to the authors’ a priori hypothesis, self-reported quit rates were nearly identical between arms at both 3- and 9-month follow-up. Although this population-based trial was conducted with methodological rigor, it did not include biochemical confirmation of abstinence—a design that is often characterized as less rigorous. Authors disagree with this characterization. The Graham et al. study is an excellent example of why biochemical confirmation is not always necessary for methodological rigor. Even if the results had not been null, biochemical confirmation would only have been necessary if there was reason to expect self-reported abstinence to be biased in favor of one group over another. Although this may be a reasonable expectation in some studies, in this case it was not. All participants received an active intervention and there was no face-to-face interaction with study staff. In other words, the demand characteristics for misreporting abstinence were low and balanced between arms. As a result, confidence can be placed in the observed treatment effect, even if absolute self-reported abstinence rates reflect some misreporting in each arm. Authors raise this issue to add to the ongoing discussion of the merits of biochemical confirmation in randomized smoking cessation trials. This discussion has a long history. Because of the rapid increase in remote trials during the COVID- 19 pandemic, their challenges are becoming increasingly evident, again shining a light on the important question of when biochemical confirmation is necessary to ensure appropriate methodological rigor and confidence in a study’s reported treatment effect. Although false reporting of abstinence clearly does occur, there are still many gaps in our knowledge about how to conduct feasible and valid remote biochemical verification. These issues warrant further empirical examination before requiring confirmation in remotely conducted cessation trials as standard practice. However, as authors hope this commentary helps illuminate, this practice may be unnecessary and even ill-advised, depending on the context of the trial.

"1437","Prospective examination of the therapeutic role of psychological flexibility and cognitive reappraisal in the ceremonial use of ayahuasca","Background: Evidence suggests that psychedelic-assisted therapy carries transdiagnostic efficacy in the treatment of mental health conditions characterized by low mood and the use of avoidance coping strategies. Aims: While preliminary evidence suggests that psychological flexibility and emotion regulation processes play an important role within psychedelic therapy, this prospective study addressed methodological gaps in the literature and examined the ability of ayahuasca to stimulate acute states of cognitive reappraisal and long-term changes in psychological flexibility and mood. The study also explored whether moderating factors predisposed participants to experience therapeutic changes. Methods: Participants ( N = 261) were recruited from three Shipibo ayahuasca retreat centers in Central and South America and completed assessments on mood, psychological flexibility, and acute ceremonial factors. Expectancy, demand characteristics, and invalid responding were controlled for with several validity scales. Results/Outcomes: Participants reported significant reductions in negative mood after three months, as well as increases in positive mood and psychological flexibility. Acute experiences of reappraisal during the ayahuasca ceremony exerted the strongest moderating effects on increases in positive mood and psychological flexibility. Increases in psychological flexibility statistically mediated the effects of acute psychological factors, including reappraisal, on changes in positive mood. Conclusions/Interpretation: These results highlight the role of acute psychological processes, such as reappraisal, and post-acute increases in psychological flexibility as putative mechanisms underlying positive outcomes associated with psychedelics. These results also provide support for the integration of third-wave and mindfulness-based therapy approaches with psychedelic-assisted interventions.
