Imagine that one day a mysterious man approaches you and begins telling you about a new method for understanding humans: Colesology. The man tells you that Colesology is an extremely effective method for estimating causal relationships. However, he adds that there's a tiny issue: sometimes the method is thrown off by a *methodological artifact*.

When you ask the Colesologist about this artifact, he explains that it sometimes causes researchers to detect an effect that is not real; other times it causes them to miss an effect that is real. Sometimes it causes estimated relationships to be biased upward; other times it causes the estimates to be biased downward. And, in general, it means that the things researchers observe using this method don't necessarily capture real-world human behavior. At this point, you might become skeptical and ask the Colesologist, "How does this methodological artifact work?" His response: they don't know, because sometimes the artifact seems to matter and sometimes it does not.

In this scenario, you would reasonably question whether Colesology is a valid method of scientific inquiry. But here's the thing: we are not describing Colesology, we are describing experimental psychology.

## Debates about demand characteristics as a methodological artifact

In 1962, Martin Orne published a seminal paper highlighting a view that challenged deeply-ingrained beliefs about the role of experiments in psychology. Rather than conceptualizing research participants as passive responders to the experimental context, Orne argued that participants actively navigate and try to make sense of the study context based on their assumptions, beliefs, and motivations. In particular, Orne emphasized that participants are perceptive to *demand characteristics:* "cues which convey an experimental hypothesis to the subject" (p. 779).

In the 60 years since Orne published his seminal paper, demand characteristics have become a literal textbook methodological concern in human subjects research (Sharpe and Whelton, 2016). But textbook psychology often does not capture the reality of the discipline. In actuality, disagreements about the extent to which demand characteristics impact participants' response persist; Uncertainty about how such effects work remains. For example, Mummolo and Peterson (2021) consistently failed to find that manipulations of their communicated hypothesis impacted participants' responses in large replications of classic studies in behavioral economics. Based on these findings, some researchers have argued that the effects of demand characteristics are "rare" (Clayton et al., 2020, p. 1092), supported by "little evidence" (Guess & Coppock, 2020, p. 1512), and/or "limited" (Vial, Brescoll, & Dovidio, 2019, p. 94). Yet, there are some contexts where these effects are more reliable. For example, in three experiments, Coles et al. (2022) found that the effects of posed facial expressions on emotional experience were moderated by demand characteristics. These facial feedback effects were larger when participants were told that the purpose of the study was to demonstrate that the effects are real and smaller when told the purpose was to demonstrate the effects are not real. Nonetheless, Coles et al. were left with the following conclusion: it is still unclear "how and when demand characteristics impact behavior" (p. 61).

In this paper, we provide an overview of a comprehensive framework for conceptualizing the impact of demand characteristics on participants\' responses (Rosnow & Rosenthal, 1997). We also review an alternative account that attempts to bridge the gap between research on demand characteristics and research on placebo effects (Coles et al., 2022). Next, we use meta-analysis to conduct the first quantitative synthesis of strict experimental tests of the effects of demand characteristics on participants\' responses. Through this meta-analysis, we not only estimate the overall impact of demand characteristics, but also use moderator analyses to provide preliminary tests of predictions made by Rosnow and Rosenthal (1997) and Coles et al., (2022). We end with a discussion of the steps required to transform frameworks about demand characteristics into formal theories---theories we believe might help distinguishing experimental psychology from the invalid methods of Colesology.
