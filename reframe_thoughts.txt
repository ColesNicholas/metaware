# Introduction
We want to understand demand characteristics.

# Overview of framework w/ DAG

# Predictions from framework
- Naturalistically, mechanisms are confounded with beliefs
- Experiments can create demand characteristics, which can both (a) activate/change beliefs, and (b) produce response bias
- Response bias depends on motivation and opportunity to adjust responses
- To conclude that an effect is driven by a mechanism, you either (1) need to produce evidence of that mechanism (e.g., by measuring or manipulating it), or (2) control for belief and response bias.
	- This could mean: 
		- No demand characteristics are present and beliefs are measured/controlled/logically eliminated
		- Demand characteristics are present and motivation/opportunity is measured/controlled/logically eliminated

# Overview of what we knew from previous resech
- Demand characteristics *can* impact participant responses, although the effects are inconsistent
- Demand characteristics *can* change beliefs, although the evidence is somewhat preliminary
- Evidence for motivation is mixed. Sigall finds that there are ways of demotivating people. But paying people to increase motivation doesn't seem to work.
- Beliefs can impact participant responses

# Overview of what we don't know
- Strength and consistency of the effects of demand characteristics
- Relative importance of the belief and response bias mechanisms
- Whether they're typically a problem

# What we learned
- Demand characteristics do matter. Their effect on participant responses is distributed similarly to other social psychological pheomenon
- Evidence for response bias continues to be shaky, but it shouldn't be dismissed
- Beliefs do matter
- Motivation to provide hypothesis-consistent responses tends to be quite low. The idea of "good subjects" just isn't supported by the evidence

# What would we need to do to solve the rest of the puzzle?
- We need to understand placebo effects. How do beliefs impact response and to what extent is salience and strenght of belief a factor?
- To a lesser extent, we probably need to understand motivated responding. When are participants motivated to adjust their responses and how does that transalte into actual changes in their responses?
