Our study was designed to better understand this fundamental methodological concern.<br>\n<br>\nIn this study, we described a variety of hypothetical scenarios where research participants were told the researcher\u2019s hypothesis. We then asked you (a) how motivated you would be to confirm the researcher\u2019s hypothesis, (b) how much you would believe the researcher\u2019s hypothesis, (c) whether you believe you could adjust your responses, and (d) whether you believe other participants would confirm the researcher\u2019s hypothesis.
