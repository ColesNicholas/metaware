During first round review, reviewers suggested that we update our literature search strategy. On April 17, 2024, this code was developed to merge (a) the original coding sheet, with (b) the outputs of two additional searches performed to address the reviewer feedback.

```{r}
# clear environment
rm(list = ls())

# load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

# open copy of what the coding sheet looks like as of 04/17/24
DF.orig <- read_excel(path = 'metaware_EsData_raw_041724.xlsx',
                      sheet = "records.screening") %>% 
  
  # clean database labels
  mutate(database = 
           if_else(database == "APA PsycInfo (2022)",
                   true = "Search 1: APA PsycInfo (2022)",
                   false = "Search 2: open call")
         )

# open first updated search
DF.new.1 <- read_excel(path = "metaware_ExpandedSearch_NewTerms_041724.xls") %>% 
  
  # add variables that will be needed for later merge
  mutate(MW_include = "",
         MW_rationale = "",
         NC_include = "",
         NC_rationale = "",
         note = "") %>%
  
  # add search info
  mutate(Database = "Search 3: APA PsycInfo (2024)") %>% 
  
  # rename and select essential variables
  rename(title = Title,
         abstract = Abstract,
         authors = Authors,
         database = Database,
         link = DocumentURL) %>% 
  
  select(title, abstract, 
         MW_include, MW_rationale, NC_include, NC_rationale, note,
         authors, year, link, database)

# open second updated search
DF.new.2 <- read_excel(path = "metaware_ExpandedSearch_OldTerms_041724.xls") %>% 
  
  # add variables that will be needed for later merge
  mutate(MW_include = "",
         MW_rationale = "",
         NC_include = "",
         NC_rationale = "",
         note = "") %>% 
  
  # add search info
  mutate(Database = "Search 4: APA PsycInfo (2024)") %>%
  
  # rename and select essential variables
  rename(title = Title,
         abstract = Abstract,
         authors = Authors,
         database = Database,
         link = DocumentURL) %>% 
  
  select(title, abstract, 
         MW_include, MW_rationale, NC_include, NC_rationale, note,
         authors, year, link, database)

# merge updated searches
DF.new <- rbind(DF.new.1, DF.new.2)

rm(DF.new.1, DF.new.2)

# merge new and old search
DF <- rbind(DF.orig, DF.new)

# examine the extent to which this new search was duplicative
DF$title %>%
  duplicated() %>%
  table() %>% 
  prop.table()

DF$title %>% duplicated %>% sum

# export
write.csv(DF,
          'metaware_EsData_raw_updated.csv',
          row.names = F)
```
