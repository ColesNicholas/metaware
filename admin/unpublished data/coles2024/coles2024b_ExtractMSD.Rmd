In this study, participants completed a line judgment task.

The study featured a 2 (no information received; information received) x 2 (information received is about the researcher's hypothesis; information received is about typical group responses) x 2 (lines are left justified first; lines are right justified first) fractional factorial design. The first factor was manipulated within-subjects, and the second and third were manipulated between-subjects.

As of June 4, 2024, data for this study have been collected at 6 sites.
