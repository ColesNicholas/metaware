Non-control demand levels
~20_p: Anomalous experiences such as apparitions, consciousness separating from the body, and strange noises are common in mirror-gazing facilities.
~20_z: Anomalous experiences such as apparitions, consciousness separating from the body, and strange noises sometimes occur in mirror-gazing facilities, but there is no consistency to it.

Fake demand scenario
~20_n: While in mirror-gazing facilities, people are less likely to experience altered states of perceptions, like apparitions and out-of-body experiences.
~20_f: Experiences such as hunger, thirst, and sadness are common in mirror-gazing facilities.

For 45 minutes, you sit in a dimly lit chamber with a white noise track playing and stare at a mirror

Imagine that you are completing an in-person study as a volunteer.
You enter the room, and the researcher tells you that anomalous experiences (unusual bodily sensations, seeing apparitions, hearing unusual sounds/voices, consciousness separates from body) have been previously found with the procedure you are about to complete.
For 45 minutes, you sit in a dimly lit chamber with a white noise track playing and stare at a mirror. You are then asked how often you experienced any visual apparitions.

For 45 minutes, you sit in a dimly lit chamber with a white noise track playing and stare at a mirror. You are then asked how often you sensed that somebody was nearby.
#20_z_vis: Nil - visual
Imagine that you are completing an in-person study as a volunteer.
You enter the room, and the researcher tells you that unusual experiences such as bodily sensations and changes in hearing/vision have been previously found with the procedure you are about to complete. However, they add that there are no consistencies in the type of experiences reported, so it’s okay to not experience anything.
