Imagine that you are a university student completing an in-person study as a volunteer or for extra course credit.
The researcher tells you that you will read a variety of positive statements. They then inform you that research has shown that reading these positive statements will lead you to feel more depressed as a result of a so-called social comparison effect.
You are then told to read 60 statements progressing from neutral to elation in tone. Afterwards, you are asked to self-report how depressed you feel.
