#18_p_ale: Positive - alertness
Imagine that you are a university student completing an in-person study for course credit or £10.
The researcher tells you that previous research has indicated that chewing gum improves cognitive performance and mood. Their study aims to find out if these effects also exist with certain computer-based tasks.
They then run you through the trial twice, one while eating two pieces of gum, and once while not. They have you complete many tests, and ask you to report your alertness during each of the trials.

Imagine that you are a university student completing an in-person study for course credit or £10.
The researcher tells you that previous research has indicated that chewing gum improves cognitive performance and mood. Their study aims to find out if these effects also exist with certain computer-based tasks.
They then run you through the trial twice, one while eating two pieces of gum, and once while not. They have you complete many tests, including a task in which two crosses appear on the screen, one of them turns into an A or a B (and the other a distraction), and you must quickly identify which letter appeared.

They then run you through the trial twice, one while eating two pieces of gum, and once while not. They have you complete many tests, including a task in which three crosses appear on the screen, the center one turns into an A or a B (and the two on the sides into a distraction), and you must quickly identify which letter appeared.
