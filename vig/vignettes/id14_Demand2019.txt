#14_p_res: Positive - resume
Imagine that you are working a free-lance job where you are paid to complete an online study.
The researcher tells you to imagine yourself as an HR officer tasked with sorting through resumes to determine which applicants should receive an interview for an entry-level sales position. They inform you that they anticipate you will be more likely to choose candidates with stereotypical White American names to receive an interview.
You are then presented with a resume, which contains either a stereotypically White American or African American name. You are then asked to indicate how willing you are to call the candidate for an interview.
