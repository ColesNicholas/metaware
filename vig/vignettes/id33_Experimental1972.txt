Imagine that you are a university student with a high fear of snakes who is completing an in-person study to fulfill a course requirement.
The researcher informs you that you will be completing a therapeutic treatment that will help reduce your fear of snakes.
For the next 3-4 weeks, you go back in twice for the therapeutic treatment, which consists of muscle relaxation and visualization exercises. Afterwards, you are placed in a room where you have a close-up encounter with a snake. Afterwards, the researcher assesses your fear of snakes.
