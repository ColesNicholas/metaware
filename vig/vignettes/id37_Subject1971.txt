Imagine that you are a physical rehabilitative hospital patient who is completing an in-person study as a volunteer.
The researcher informs you that they expect your attitudes towards the hospital and yourself to change due to your 4-6 week hospital stay for physical rehabilitative therapy.
After the hospital stay, they ask you whether your attitudes have changed.
