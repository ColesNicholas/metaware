#04_p_age: Positive - agency
Imagine that you are completing an in-person study as a volunteer or for extra credit.
The researcher tells you that you will complete a challenging visual perception test while undergoing a brain stimulation procedure. They subsequently explain why they believe this brain stimulation will improve your performance.
You complete the visual perception test. Each time you make an error, you are asked to report whether your response was impacted by the brain stimulation.
#04_n_age: Negative - agency
Imagine that you are completing an in-person study as a volunteer or for extra credit.
The researcher tells you that you will complete a challenging visual perception test while undergoing a brain stimulation procedure. They subsequently explain why they believe this brain stimulation will impair your performance.
You complete the visual perception test. Each time you make an error, you are asked to report whether your response was impacted by the brain stimulation.
#04_p_per: Positive - performance
Imagine that you are completing an in-person study as a volunteer or for extra credit.
The researcher tells you that you will complete a challenging visual perception test while undergoing a brain stimulation procedure. They subsequently explain why they believe this brain stimulation will improve your performance.
You complete the visual perception test. Afterwards, you are asked to report whether your performance was impacted by the brain stimulation.
#04_n_per: Negative - performance
Imagine that you are completing an in-person study as a volunteer or for extra credit.
The researcher tells you that you will complete a challenging visual perception test while undergoing a brain stimulation procedure. They subsequently explain why they believe this brain stimulation will impair your performance.

#04_p_err: Positive - errors
Imagine that you are completing an in-person study as a volunteer or for extra credit.
The researcher tells you that you will complete a challenging visual perception test while undergoing a brain stimulation procedure. They subsequently explain why they believe this brain stimulation will improve your performance.
You complete the visual perception test, and the number of errors you make is measured.
#04_n_err: Negative - errors
Imagine that you are completing an in-person study as a volunteer or for extra credit.
The researcher tells you that you will complete a challenging visual perception test while undergoing a brain stimulation procedure. They subsequently explain why they believe this brain stimulation will impair your performance.
You complete the visual perception test, and the number of errors you make is measured.
#04_p_rea: Positive - reaction time
Imagine that you are completing an in-person study as a volunteer or for extra credit.
The researcher tells you that you will complete a challenging visual perception test while undergoing a brain stimulation procedure. They subsequently explain why they believe this brain stimulation will improve your performance.
You complete the visual perception test, and the speed in which you complete the task is measured.
#04_n_rea: Negative - reaction time
Imagine that you are completing an in-person study as a volunteer or for extra credit.
The researcher tells you that you will complete a challenging visual perception test while undergoing a brain stimulation procedure. They subsequently explain why they believe this brain stimulation will impair your performance.
