Imagine that you are a university student completing an in-person study as a volunteer or for extra credit.
The researcher walks you to a hill and asks you to put on a heavy backpack. Afterwards, they tell you they expect the backpack to have no impact on your perception of the steepness of the hill.
While you stand at the bottom of the hill with the heavy backpack on, the researcher then asks you to verbally report how steep the hill is.
